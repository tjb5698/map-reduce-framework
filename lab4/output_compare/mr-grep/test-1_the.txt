99: Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
100: that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to

103: of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a

107: with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
109: with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
110: "primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
111: methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
113: What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
114: student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
115: intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
116: to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
117: doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
119: of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
120: walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
121: informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
122: it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
124: when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
126: intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
128: to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
129: books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
131: We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
132: given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has

135: the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
137: Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
138: but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.

948: science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
949: the eventfulness of recent advances?
951: But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
952: if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
953: discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
955: they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
956: It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
957: sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
958: the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
960: take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
961: the world always new.
963: The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
964: be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
965: the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
966: kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
967: of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
969: voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
972: The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
974: far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
975: ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
977: the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
978: chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
979: suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
981: which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
982: been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
983: simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
984: the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
989: It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
990: be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
991: static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
992: matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
993: Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
994: have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
996: by the board.
998: The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
1000: The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
1001: understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
1003: up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
1004: are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
1005: radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
1006: the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
1008: The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
1010: conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
1012: can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
1013: knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
1014: of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
1015: light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
1016: guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is: is there
1017: _one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
1020: But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
1023: As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
1024: have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
1025: instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
1026: messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
1027: the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
1028: body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
1029: Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
1030: may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
1032: much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
1033: physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
1037: the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
1038: invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
1040: causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
1042: mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
1043: been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
1044: of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
1045: supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
1047: educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
1048: Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
1050: The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
1051: movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
1053: flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
1054: types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
1055: "experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
1058: The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
1059: provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
1060: surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
1063: of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
1066: Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
1067: precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
1068: methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
1069: they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
1070: of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
1072: The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
1073: view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
1074: with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
1094: The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
1095: Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
1096: is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
1097: are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
1098: which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
1099: knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
1101:     The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
1102:     great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
1103:     the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
1104:     object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
1105:     occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
1106:     Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
1107:     imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
1109:     admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
1110:     the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
1112:     contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
1115:     question is intimately associated with the question whether the
1116:     stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
1117:     permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
1123: The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
1124: relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
1125: comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
1126: are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
1127: the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
1128: of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
1129: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
1130: the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
1131: invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
1133: is called the Solar System.
1135: The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
1138: the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
1139: by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
1141: the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
1142: this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
1143: the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
1144: distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
1146: millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
1147: double this distance from the earth.
1149: We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
1152: the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
1153: great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
1154: Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
1155: of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
1156: call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
1157: surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
1162: One of the greatest mathematical astronomers of all time and the
1163: originator of the nebular theory.]
1169: who, anticipating the great French mathematician, Le Verrier, discovered
1170: the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the
1171: orbit of Uranus. One of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of
1178: Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge. The most famous of the English
1187: The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
1189: _one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
1190: time as we use them; that is: Jupiter's "Day" (one rotation of the
1192: of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
1193: "Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
1194: the Sun.]
1199: On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
1200: greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
1201: than all the other planets put together.]
1203: Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
1204: tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
1205: atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
1206: stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
1208: creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
1209: the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
1210: hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
1213: In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
1214: than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
1216: path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
1217: times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
1218: pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
1219: direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
1220: tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
1221: balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
1222: almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
1223: to their orbits.
1225: Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
1226: sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
1227: sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
1228: eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
1229: sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
1230: the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
1233: The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
1234: round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
1235: that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
1236: into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
1237: orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
1238: fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
1239: are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
1243: space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
1244: the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
1245: specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
1247: farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
1248: out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
1249: here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
1258: The Scale of the Universe
1260: How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
1261: tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
1263: pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
1264: that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
1266: stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
1267: there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
1271: Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
1272: other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
1273: have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
1274: astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
1275: and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
1276: planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
1277: the Solar System.
1279: The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
1280: 92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
1282: now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
1284: photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
1285: tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
1286: is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
1287: star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
1288: star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
1292: This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
1294: miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
1295: the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
1296: figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
1297: method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
1298: deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
1299: from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
1301: that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
1302: thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
1304: Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
1305: hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
1308: of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
1309: take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
1313: Are there other Universes?
1315: Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
1319: other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
1320: many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
1321: abysses of space. Probably there are.
1324: the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
1326: regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
1327: most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
1328: universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
1330: the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
1331: that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
1332: nebulæ are "other universes."

1348: Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
1349: comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
1350: on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
1360: But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
1363: Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
1364: interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
1365: planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
1366: temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
1367: and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
1368: originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
1372: concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
1374: the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
1375: answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
1376: stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
1377: at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
1378: the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
1380: that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
1381: we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
1382: matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
1384: instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
1387:     "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
1389:     our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
1391:     that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
1393:     can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
1394:     instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
1396: Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
1397: answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
1398: refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
1399: genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
1400: phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
1401: time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
1402: patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
1403: grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
1408: In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
1409: which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
1410: heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
1411: multitude of meteors: in other words, all bodies whose movements in
1412: space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
1417: Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
1418: used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
1420: Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
1421: represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
1422: the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
1423: silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
1425: space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
1426: light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
1427: spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
1428: detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
1431: We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
1432: are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
1433: remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
1434: be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
1438: Regions of the Sun
1440: The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
1441: layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
1442: somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
1443: vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
1444: innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
1447: we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
1449: Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
1450: glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
1451: cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
1454: A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
1455: region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000

1463: feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
1465: During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
1467: miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
1468: or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
1471: These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
1472: not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
1473: obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
1474: the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
1475: time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
1476: been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
1477: 7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope:
1479:     It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
1481:     way remarkable except for its size. At 12:30 p.m. the Professor left
1482:     the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
1483:     later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
1485:     flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
1486:     100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
1487:     even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
1488:     the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
1489:     January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
1490:     Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
1492:     miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
1493:     flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
1494:     solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
1495:     still tower above them.[1]

1521: The fourth and uppermost layer or region is that of the corona, of
1522: immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have
1523: already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
1524: these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
1525: layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
1530: The Surface of the Sun
1532: Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
1533: photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
1534: gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
1535: believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
1536: that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
1537: go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
1539: 92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
1540: activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
1543: dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
1544: observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
1545: and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
1546: great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
1547: muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
1550: The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
1551: the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
1554: exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
1556: But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
1557: pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
1564: It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
1565: sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
1566: contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
1567: covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
1568: cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
1569: surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
1570: great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
1571: immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
1574: Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
1576: magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
1577: and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
1578: compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
1579: two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
1580: may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
1581: storm" effects on the earth.
1583: A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
1585: years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
1586: then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
1587: Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
1588: some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
1589: structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their

1599: of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
1600: other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
1601: display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
1602: but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
1603: phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
1604: influence of the sun.]
1606: It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
1607: surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
1608: "equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
1609: south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
1610: two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
1611: equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
1614: What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
1616: magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
1617: the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
1619: It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
1620: our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
1621: spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
1628: it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
1630: made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
1632: analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
1634: ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
1635: say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
1637: the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
1638: sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
1639: moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
1640: according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
1644: shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
1645: for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
1646: as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
1647: we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
1648: one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
1649: to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
1650: composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
1655: This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
1656: spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
1657: colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
1658: That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its

1667: separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
1669: displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
1670: spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
1671: was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such

1701: Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
1703: as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
1704: for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
1705: a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of

1712: of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
1713: made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
1714: dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
1715: being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
1716: gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
1717: statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
1720: Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
1723: white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
1724: photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
1725: relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
1726: element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
1727: kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
1728: photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
1729: as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
1731: significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
1732: out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
1733: be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
1734: able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
1735: coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the

1745: In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences

1747: attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
1748: _helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
1749: minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
1750: therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
1751: before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
1752: thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
1753: sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
1755: light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
1759: Measuring the Speed of Light
1761: But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
1762: found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
1763: to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
1764: direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
1765: to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
1766: measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
1767: and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
1768: astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
1770: sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
1771: the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
1772: definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
1773: the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
1774: If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
1775: spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
1776: the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
1777: otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
1778: for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
1779: the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
1780: the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
1785: This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
1788: relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
1797: Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
1799: To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
1804: be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
1805: thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
1806: On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
1807: combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
1809: and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
1810: of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
1811: nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
1812: were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
1813: combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
1815: and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
1816: such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
1819: on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
1820: years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
1822: And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
1823: merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
1824: originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
1825: Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
1826: of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
1827: words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
1828: steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
1829: past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
1832: energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
1833: of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
1834: it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
1835: another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
1837: matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
1838: the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
1839: the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
1840: straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
1841: because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
1842: inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
1844: tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
1846: completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
1848: this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
1852: It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
1853: would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
1854: The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
1855: from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
1856: amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
1857: system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
1858: sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
1859: their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
1860: for the sun's heat.
1862: Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
1863: may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
1864: maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
1867: split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
1869: The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
1870: disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
1871: disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
1872: have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
1883: It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
1884: or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
1885: on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
1886: the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
1887: cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
1889: think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
1891: least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
1892: of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
1893: rest of the universe.
1895: In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
1896: out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
1897: probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
1898: to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
1899: in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
1900: always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
1901: sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
1902: other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
1908: The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
1909: and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
1910: possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
1911: has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
1912: like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
1913: therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
1914: and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
1915: surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
1918: rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
1919: and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
1920: we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
1926: these craters, and some theories of their origin are explained on page
1932:      showing many of the
1933:  2} canals. Taken in 1907 by Mr. E. C. Slipher of the Lowell Observatory.
1937: Nos. 1 and 2 show the effect of the planet's rotation. Nos. 3 and 4
1938: depict quite different sections. Note the change in the polar snow-caps
1939: in the last two.]
1943: Note the mysterious "rays" diverging from the almost perfectly circular
1944: craters indicated by the arrows (Tycho, upper; Copernicus, lower), and
1945: also the mountains to the right with the lunar dawn breaking on them.]
1947: We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
1948: speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
1949: _is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
1952: Is there Life on Mars?
1954: The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
1955: solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
1956: have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
1957: development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
1958: cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
1959: a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
1960: life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
1961: evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
1965: But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
1966: water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
1967: there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
1968: made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
1969: straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
1970: that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
1971: pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
1972: ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
1973: the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
1974: There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
1975: spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
1977: Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
1978: in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
1980: the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
1981: sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
1984: If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
1986: from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
1987: seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
1988: a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
1989: eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
1990: to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
1993: In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
1994: and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
1997: not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
1998: time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
1999: semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
2000: least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
2001: cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
2002: could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
2003: there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
2004: the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
2005: brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
2013: Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
2014: Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
2015: space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
2018: one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
2019: theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
2020: material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the

2026: interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn

2028: direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
2029: But there is no life on Jupiter.
2032: steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
2033: red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
2034: and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
2036: core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
2037: whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
2038: the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
2039: rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
2041: they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
2043: Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
2044: photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
2045: that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
2047: Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
2050: this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
2051: more than the central fire.
2053: Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
2056: of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
2058: few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
2060: has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
2061: have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
2067: Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
2068: which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
2069: very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
2070: range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
2072: 3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
2073: these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
2078: The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
2081: sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
2082: us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
2084: against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
2085: few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
2086: or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
2087: some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
2088: probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a

2092: taking place on the moon.
2097: The plains were originally supposed to be seas: hence the name "Mare."]
2105: Notice the tendency to form a number of tails. (See photograph below.)]
2111: The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
2114: But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
2115: the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
2116: shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
2117: atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
2118: produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
2120: will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
2121: a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the

2125: twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
2129: visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
2130: there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
2134: its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
2135: temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
2137: another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
2138: diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
2139: follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
2140: enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
2141: Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
2142: the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
2143: coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
2144: points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
2145: of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
2146: temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
2147: below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
2150: The Mountains of the Moon
2152: The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
2153: explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
2154: surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
2155: it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
2156: meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
2157: was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
2158: gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
2160: that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
2161: volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
2162: these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
2163: saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
2166: The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
2171: but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
2175: seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
2176: the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
2177: but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
2179: there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
2180: long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
2185: We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
2187: know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
2191: above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
2192: enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
2193: time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
2200: our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
2201: ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
2202: even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
2205: It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
2206: solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
2207: Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
2208: The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
2209: examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
2210: comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
2211: 19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
2212: pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
2214: dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
2215: a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
2216: sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
2217: fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
2218: ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
2219: always points away from the sun.
2224: The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
2225: approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
2226: million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
2227: imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
2228: the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
2229: in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
2230: They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
2231: dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
2232: then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
2233: thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the

2268: more than 300 times that of the sun.
2273: The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
2274: through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
2275: sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
2276: spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
2277: sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
2278: whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
2281: In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
2282: in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
2284: irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
2285: stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
2286: matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
2287: evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
2288: also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
2289: themselves pass on their way to extinction.
2291: The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
2292: spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
2293: which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
2298: In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
2299: we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
2300: the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
2301: the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
2302: stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
2303: become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
2305: shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
2306: the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
2308: mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
2312: star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
2313: heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
2314: and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
2317: than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
2318: into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
2320: successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
2321: consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
2322: to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
2325: The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
2332: Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
2334: the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
2335: being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
2336: not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
2337: given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
2338: distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
2339: known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
2340: these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
2341: some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
2344: nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
2346: There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
2347: that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
2352: the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
2354: contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
2355: gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
2357: sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
2358: is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
2360: exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
2361: and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
2362: luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
2363: would seem to fit the case better.
2365: Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
2366: have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
2367: the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
2368: that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
2369: to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
2370: process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
2371: the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
2378: It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
2379: rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
2382: condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
2383: nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
2384: have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
2385: development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
2386: some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
2387: in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
2388: striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
2389: fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
2390: Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
2391: comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
2392: and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
2394: These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
2395: of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
2396: by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
2398: and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
2400: that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

2427: following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
2428: of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
2429: is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
2430: the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
2431: vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
2432: point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
2433: received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
2438: One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
2441: case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
2442: that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
2445: to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
2446: in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
2447: more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
2449: interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
2450: in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
2451: know their masses and their distances from each other.
2459: population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
2460: already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
2462: this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
2463: the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
2464: whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
2465: declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
2466: only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
2467: future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
2468: in the ether of space.
2470: The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
2471: the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
2472: announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
2474: much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
2475: you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
2476: distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
2477: Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
2479: centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
2481: times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
2485: There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
2486: cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
2487: population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
2490: rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
2492: hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
2493: and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to

2497: another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
2499: regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
2500: matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
2502: But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
2503: think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
2518: What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
2520: living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
2521: what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
2523: similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
2524: instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
2525: insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
2526: approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
2527: denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
2528: simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
2529: shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
2530: along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
2531: angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
2532: the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
2533: heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
2534: Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
2535: thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
2536: angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
2537: form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
2538: angles to point to the north and south poles.
2541: situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
2542: near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
2543: of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
2544: within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
2545: these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
2547: another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
2548: the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
2550: stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
2551: quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
2552: one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
2553: eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
2554: own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
2555: these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
2557: is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
2558: lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
2560: us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
2561: This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
2563: of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
2564: from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
2565: Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
2566: patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
2567: Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
2568: in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
2569: hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
2571: the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
2572: is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
2574: distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
2576: our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
2577: we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our

2655: In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
2656: questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
2657: questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
2658: emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
2659: us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
2660: heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
2670: The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
2671: of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
2672: different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
2673: which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
2674: astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
2675: without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
2677: There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
2678: constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
2679: time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
2680: imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
2681: the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
2683: instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
2684: that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
2685: Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
2686: early instruments have only an historic interest: the era of modern
2687: telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
2689: During the last century telescope construction underwent an
2691: the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
2692: world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
2693: instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
2695: and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
2697: mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
2698: the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
2699: large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
2700: at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
2702: proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
2703: tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
2704: the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
2705: large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
2706: bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
2707: it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
2708: refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
2709: light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
2710: light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
2711: times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
2712: amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
2713: and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
2718: order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
2720: is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
2721: great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
2722: Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
2723: on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
2724: three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector

2733: The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting

2757: and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
2759: But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
2760: great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
2761: simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
2762: human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
2763: glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
2764: photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
2766: shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
2767: impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
2768: which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
2770: visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
2771: the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
2774: Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
2775: the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
2776: mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
2777: by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
2778: apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
2779: is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
2780: clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
2782: as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
2783: instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
2785: refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
2786: instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
2787: Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
2788: are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
2789: crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
2790: time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
2791: these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
2792: with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and

2795: stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
2796: furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
2797: them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
2798: du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
2805: We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
2806: the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
2807: constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
2808: the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
2809: single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
2811: accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
2812: of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
2813: The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
2814: light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
2816: number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
2818: unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
2821: Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
2823: piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
2824: lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
2825: them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
2827: several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
2828: spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
2832: it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
2836: conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
2837: object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
2838: laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
2839: effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,

2892: The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
2895: intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
2896: to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
2897: it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
2898: folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
2899: been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
2900: change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
2901: final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
2902: all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less

2977: The Beginning of the Earth
2979: When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
2981: did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
2982: phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
2983: the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
2984: the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
2985: nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
2986: been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
2991: The Nebular Hypothesis
2993: One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
2994: upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
2995: Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
2997: As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
2998: increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
2999: broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
3000: planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
3001: planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
3002: the sun.
3004: Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
3006: the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
3008: distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
3009: been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
3010: difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
3011: from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
3014: So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
3015: as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
3016: Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
3018: years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
3019: voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
3020: are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
3021: difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
3023: scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
3024: Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
3025: of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
3026: our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
3027: account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
3028: favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
3029: According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
3030: from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
3031: the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
3032: like many of those now observed in the heavens.
3034: Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting

3038: minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
3042: The Growth of the Earth
3044: It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
3045: Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
3047: 8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
3048: by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
3050: during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
3052: A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
3053: matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
3054: assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
3055: deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
3056: granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
3058: and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
3059: distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
3062: The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
3064: the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
3065: began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
3066: any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
3067: and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
3068: from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
3069: high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
3070: material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
3079: It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
3080: conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
3081: allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
3082: LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
3084: temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
3085: the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the

3150: that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,

3155: drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
3156: that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities

3175: Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
3177: far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
3179: organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
3180: been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one

3200: The First Organisms upon the Earth
3202: We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
3203: creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
3204: earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
3205: creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
3207: very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
3208: be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
3209: creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
3213: or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
3214: makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
3215: breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
3217: encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
3218: itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
3219: which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
3221: them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
3222: paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
3223: there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
3224: covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
3225: of the Vegetable Kingdom.
3227: On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
3229: water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
3230: closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
3231: or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
3232: Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
3233: amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
3234: from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may

3237: earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
3238: of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
3239: the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
3240: dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
3252: However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
3253: first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
3254: genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
3255: the ways in the whole history of Nature.
3257: Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
3258: level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
3259: their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
3260: so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
3261: manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
3262: below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
3263: nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
3264: keep them sluggish.
3266: Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
3268: albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
3270: much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
3271: Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
3272: an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
3273: the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
3274: disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
3275: the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
3276: ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
3277: plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
3278: work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
3279: photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

3306: As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
3307: much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
3308: fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
3309: kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
3310: crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
3311: sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
3312: and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
3313: regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
3314: statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
3315: in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
3316: often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
3317: of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
3318: flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
3319: genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
3320: depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
3321: speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
3322: human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
3323: to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
3324: leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
3325: acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
3332: It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
3333: and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
3334: the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
3335: about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
3336: solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
3337: floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
3338: light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
3340: this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
3341: floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
3342: there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
3343: of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
3344: when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
3346: glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
3351: Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
3353: that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
3354: of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
3355: majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
3356: as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
3357: complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
3359: not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
3360: have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
3361: these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
3362: structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
3366: In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
3367: of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
3368: steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
3369: Protozoa: (_a_) Some were very active, the Infusorians, like the slipper
3370: animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
3371: phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
3372: Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
3373: Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
3374: man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
3376: line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
3377: Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
3378: exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
3379: have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
3380: animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
3383: performing other useful offices.
3390: The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
3391: Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
3392: animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
3394: showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
3395: to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
3396: evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
3399: more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed

3405: Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
3406: kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
3407: of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
3408: which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
3409: This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
3410: duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
3411: part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
3412: these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
3413: be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
3414: body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
3420: For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
3421: than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has

3425: way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
3428: which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
3429: but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
3430: many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
3431: or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
3432: daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
3433: reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
3434: that made the first body possible.
3439: A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
3441: to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may

3447: physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the

3469: study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
3470: importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
3471: some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
3472: the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
3477: The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
3478: animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
3479: or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
3480: _multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
3481: different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
3482: lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
3487: One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of

3493: Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
3494: multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
3496: simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of

3498: in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
3499: full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
3500: cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
3501: cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
3505: started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the

3512: consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
3513: implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
3515: a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
3516: move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
3524: Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
3525: of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
3527: constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
3528: lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
3529: seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
3530: there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
3531: egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
3535: indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
3536: other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
3537: difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
3539: discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
3540: (metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
3541: superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
3542: such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
3543: physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
3544: ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
3545: the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
3546: modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
3547: characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
3548: messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
3549: throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
3551: for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
3552: female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
3553: kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
3554: ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.

3583: Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
3584: parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
3585: the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
3586: the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
3587: violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
3588: This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
3591: which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
3592: living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
3593: works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
3595: which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
3596: later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
3597: is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
3598: many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
3600: large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
3601: death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
3602: recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
3603: Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
3605: measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
3606: many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
3607: is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
3608: evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
3609: of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
3610: liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
3611: of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
3613: Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
3614: considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best

3701: which they also contribute.
3703: Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)

3724: and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the

3732: there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
3734: between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
3735: can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
3736: after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
3737: with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
3739: cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
3740: potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
3741: the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
3742: feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
3743: to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
3744: be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
3745: in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
3746: individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
3747: that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
3748: cannot put our finger on any point and say: Before this stage there was
3749: no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there

3781: the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
3782: basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got

3790: the shield: the environment acts upon the organism; that is the other
3791: side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
3792: what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
3794: advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
3797: earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.

3898: Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
3899: beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
3900: of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
3901: the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
3904: its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
3908: Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
3909: vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
3910: from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory

3915: from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
3917: use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus

3921: that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
3923: controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
3925: some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
3927: ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
3928: and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
3929: trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the

3966: lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
3968: collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
3970: and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
3971: she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
3972: this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
3973: fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
3974: real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
3975: destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
3976: the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
3977: secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
3981: of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
3982: to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
3983: endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
3986: purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
3988: mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
3989: routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
3993: one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
3994: cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
3995: the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
3996: entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
3998: the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
3999: than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
4004: The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
4005: in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
4006: be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
4008: ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they

4021: Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
4022: this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
4024: behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
4025: been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
4026: enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
4027: that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
4030: There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
4032: behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
4033: definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
4043: expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
4045: with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
4047: there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
4048: other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
4049: problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
4050: of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
4053: But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
4054: entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
4055: and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
4056: trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
4057: much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
4058: and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
4059: evolution to which the animal has attained.
4061: Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
4062: safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
4063: ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
4064: advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
4065: young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
4066: reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
4067: of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
4068: existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
4069: parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
4071: In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
4072: a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
4073: environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
4074: months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
4075: There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
4076: exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
4077: though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated

4087: Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
4089: the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
4090: prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
4091: while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
4092: life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn

4147: It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
4148: crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for

4151: open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn

4155: period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
4156: to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
4157: view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
4158: youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
4159: return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
4161: that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
4162: shore of the sea and the open sea.
4167: 3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
4168: which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
4170: night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
4171: of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
4173: there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one

4175: sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
4177: us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
4178: difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
4179: It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
4180: relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
4181: antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
4182: to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after

4188: 4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
4191: from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some

4218: difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
4220: ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
4221: as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
4222: by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
4223: oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
4224: idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
4225: oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes

4231: locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed

4234: tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
4235: adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
4236: trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
4237: the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
4238: earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
4239: earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
4240: centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
4241: pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
4245: Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
4247: A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that

4259: but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the

4262: necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs

4267: can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
4268: surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
4269: eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
4270: many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
4271: in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
4272: them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
4273: about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
4274: great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
4275: small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
4276: the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
4277: the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.

4351: established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
4352: and the succession of their advances? The answer is: by reading the Rock
4353: Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
4354: into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
4356: hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
4357: air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
4360: sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
4361: been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
4362: thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to

4374: the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different

4378: order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the

4381: strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before

4383: reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
4384: fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
4387: If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and

4404: Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
4405: process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
4406: long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
4407: for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
4408: fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
4410: years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
4412: the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
4413: likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
4414: it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
4416: the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
4417: have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
4418: amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
4419: for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
4420: approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
4421: the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no

4487: The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to

4585: The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
4586: of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
4587: time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of

4589: discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
4590: Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
4591: the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
4592: the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
4593: they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there

4606: strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
4607: There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
4609: their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
4610: jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
4611: centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
4613: far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
4614: plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
4615: said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
4616: Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
4620: justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
4621: monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
4622: great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
4623: forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
4624: invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
4625: They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
4626: attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
4629: period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
4630: accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
4632: energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
4633: then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
4638: As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
4639: fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
4640: the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
4641: from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
4644: when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
4645: must be: (_a_) that local drying up of water-basins or elevations of the
4646: land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
4647: have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
4648: (_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
4649: throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
4650: migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
4651: over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
4652: the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
4654: grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
4655: things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
4656: soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
4657: were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
4658: the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
4660: tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
4661: to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
4662: it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
4663: of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
4664: becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
4665: for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
4666: is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
4667: millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
4668: made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
4669: passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
4670: larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
4671: upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
4672: thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
4673: insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
4674: were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
4675: one of the great steps in organic evolution.

4699: This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
4700: three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
4701: in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
4702: down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
4703: accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
4709: The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
4716: Evolution of the Voice
4718: The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
4719: toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
4720: with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
4721: that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
4722: Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
4723: helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
4724: birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
4725: on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
4726: crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
4727: mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
4728: emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
4739: In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
4740: began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
4741: backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
4742: of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
4743: at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
4744: vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
4745: without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
4746: allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
4747: growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
4748: evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
4749: membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
4750: which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
4751: emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
4752: foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
4754: are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
4755: Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
4757: It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
4758: mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
4759: ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
4761: where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
4762: gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
4763: first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
4764: back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
4766: except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
4767: influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
4769: condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
4770: million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
4772: In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
4774: an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
4775: world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
4776: the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
4777: cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
4778: Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
4779: Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
4781: Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
4782: of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
4784: and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
4785: for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
4787: as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
4788: animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
4793: We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
4794: ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large

4805: King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
4806: otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
4807: belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
4808: have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
4811: Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
4812: Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
4813: was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
4814: backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
4815: the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
4816: air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
4817: appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
4818: are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
4819: _Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
4820: air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
4830: In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
4831: reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
4832: established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
4834: birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
4836: In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
4837: the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
4839: lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
4840: Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
4841: limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
4842: look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
4844: there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
4845: sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
4851: The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
4853: there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
4855: alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
4856: attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
4857: extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
4858: finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
4859: five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
4860: an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
4861: more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
4862: they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
4863: flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of

4888: peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
4890: these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern

4924: There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
4925: Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
4926: lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
4927: long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
4928: the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
4930: it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
4931: jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
4932: apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
4933: before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the

4938: In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
4939: giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
4940: multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
4941: the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
4942: probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
4943: Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
4944: their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
4945: they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
4946: insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
4947: began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
4948: of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
4949: race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
4950: exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
4953: There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
4954: mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
4956: ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which

4961: there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
4962: first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
4963: record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
4966: Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
4967: Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence: "The Mesozoic is the Age
4968: of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
4969: storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
4970: cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
4977: In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
4979: associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
4981: mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
4984: During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
4985: became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
4987: The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning

4997: animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
4998: experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
4999: what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
5000: types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
5001: that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
5003: the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may

5012: were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
5013: underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
5014: as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
5015: new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
5016: of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
5017: Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
5018: into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
5021: elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
5022: less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
5023: for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
5024: sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
5025: Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
5026: North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
5027: the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
5028: snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
5029: Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
5034:     "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more

5088: and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
5089: and then the fingers.]
5091: But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
5092: solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
5093: similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
5095: None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
5100: fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
5102: It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
5106:     all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
5107:     debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
5108:     the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
5109:     penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
5110:     system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
5111:     frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
5116: There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
5117: overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
5118: inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
5120: distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
5121: juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
5122: vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
5123: sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
5124: unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
5125: the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
5126: co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
5127: partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
5128: inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
5131: bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
5132: whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
5134: one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
5135: the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
5136: of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
5139: Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
5144: are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
5149: It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
5150: living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
5152: easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
5155: everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
5156: creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
5157: animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
5158: is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
5160: This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
5163: boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
5164: food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
5165: there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
5169: But there are two sides to this minor chapter: there is the evolution of
5170: the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
5171: on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
5172: wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
5173: and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
5174: is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
5175: substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
5176: poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
5185: There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
5186: evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
5188: compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
5189: we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
5190: fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
5192: harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
5193: discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
5195: understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
5196: been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
5197: increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
5198: advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
5204: In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
5205: granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
5206: answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
5207: the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
5208: prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
5209: a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
5212: But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
5213: the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
5214: _historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
5215: that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
5216: these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
5219: very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
5223: There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
5224: reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
5225: the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
5227: the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
5228: to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
5236: cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
5241: There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
5242: fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
5243: of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
5244: of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
5245: results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
5246: sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
5247: there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
5248: ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
5249: by the way in which it works.
5256: If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
5257: _factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
5258: greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
5259: young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
5263: these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
5264: outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
5265: organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
5266: germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
5267: inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
5268: multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
5269: reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
5270: changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
5272: as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
5273: germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
5275: reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
5276: sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
5277: fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
5279: something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
5280: to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
5281: in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
5282: often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
5283: they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
5284: they are transmissible.
5286: Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
5287: inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
5288: sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
5289: fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
5290: many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
5291: organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
5293: will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
5294: survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
5295: increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
5296: sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the

5340: We saw in a previous chapter how the process of evolution led to a
5341: mastery of all the haunts of life. But it is necessary to return to
5342: these haunts or homes of animals in some detail, so as to understand the
5343: peculiar circumstances of each, and to see how in the course of ages of
5346: have spread over all the earth and in the waters under the earth; some
5347: of them have conquered the underground world and others the air. It is
5349: haunts of life, each tenanted by a distinctive fauna, namely, the shore
5350: of the sea, the open sea, the depths of the sea, the freshwaters, the
5351: dry land, and the air. In the deep sea there are no plants at all; in
5352: the air the only plants are floating bacteria, though there is a sense
5353: in which a tree is very aerial, and the orchid perched on its branches
5354: still more so; in the other four haunts there is a flora as well as a
5355: fauna--the two working into one another's hands in interesting and often
5356: subtle inter-relations--the subject of a separate study.
5363: By the shore of the sea the zoologist means much more than the narrow
5364: zone between tide-marks; he means the whole of the relatively shallow,
5365: well-illumined, seaweed-growing shelf around the continents and
5366: continental islands. Technically, this is called the littoral area, and
5368: may be noted that the green seaweeds are highest up on the shore; the
5369: brown ones come next; the beautiful red ones are lowest. All of them
5370: have got green chlorophyll, which enables them to utilise the sun's rays
5371: in photosynthesis (i.e. building up carbon compounds from air, water,
5372: and salts), but in the brown and red seaweeds the green pigment is
5373: masked by others. It is maintained by some botanists that these other
5374: pigments enable their possessors to make more of the scantier light in
5375: the deeper waters. However this may be, we must always think of the
5376: shore-haunt as the seaweed-growing area. Directly and indirectly the
5377: life of the shore animals is closely wrapped up with the seaweeds, which
5378: afford food and foothold, and temper the force of the waves. The minute

5389: only about 9 million square miles, a small fraction of the 197,000,000
5390: of the whole earth's surface. But it is a very long haunt, some 150,000
5392: deep water comes close to cliffs there may be no shore at all; in other
5393: places the relatively shallow water, with seaweeds growing over the
5394: bottom, may extend outwards for miles. The nature of the shore varies
5395: greatly according to the nature of the rocks, according to what the
5396: streams bring down from inland, and according to the jetsam that is
5397: brought in by the tides. The shore is a changeful place; there is, in
5398: the upper reaches, a striking difference between "tide in" and "tide
5399: out"; there are vicissitudes due to storms, to freshwater floods, to
5402: among the rocks may be precious.
5407: These molluscs are particularly fond of crustaceans, which they crunch
5408: with their parrot's beak-like jaws. Their salivary juice has a
5409: paralysing effect on their prey. To one side, below the eye, may be seen
5410: the funnel through which water is very forcibly ejected in the process

5424: observation on the Californian coast.)]
5430: The delicate shell is made by the female only, and is used as a shelter
5431: for the eggs and young ones. It is secreted by two of the arms, not by
5432: the mantle as other mollusc shells are. It is a single-chambered shell,
5433: very different from that of the Pearly Nautilus.]
5438: It follows that the shore must be the scene of a keen struggle for
5439: existence--which includes all the answers-back that living creatures
5441: food, accentuated by the fact that small items tend to be swept away by
5442: the outgoing tide or to sink down the slope to deep water. Apart from
5445: creatures. Thus the Crumb-of-Bread Sponge, or any other seashore sponge,
5446: has to lash large quantities of water through the intricate canal system
5447: of its body before it can get a sufficient supply of the microscopic
5448: organisms and organic particles on which it feeds. An index of the
5449: intensity of the struggle for food is afforded by the nutritive chains
5450: which bind animals together. The shore is almost noisy with the
5451: conjugation of the verb to eat in its many tenses. One pound of rock-cod
5454: pounds of sea-dust. Such is the circulation of matter, ever passing from
5455: one embodiment or incarnation to another.
5457: Besides struggle for food there is struggle for foothold and for fresh
5458: air, struggle against the scouring tide and against the pounding
5459: breakers. The risk of dislodgment is often great and the fracture of
5460: limbs is a common accident. Of kinds of armour--the sea-urchin's
5461: hedgehog-like test, the crab's shard, the limpet's shell--there is great
5462: variety, surpassed only by that of weapons--the sea-anemone's
5463: stinging-cells, the sea-urchin's snapping-blades, the hermit-crab's
5464: forceps, the grappling tentacles and parrot's-beak jaws of the octopus.
5469: We get another glimpse of the intensity of the seashore struggle for
5470: existence in the frequency of "shifts for a living," adaptations of
5472: The starfish is often in the dilemma of losing a limb or its life; by a
5473: reflex action it jettisons the captured arm and escapes. And what is
5475: mending; it casts off the leg across a weak breakage plane near the

5480: In another part of this book there is a discussion of camouflaging and
5481: protective resemblance; how abundantly these are illustrated on the
5482: shore! But there are other "shifts for a living." Some of the
5483: sand-hoppers and their relatives illustrate the puzzling phenomenon of
5484: "feigning death," becoming suddenly so motionless that they escape the
5485: eyes of their enemies. Cuttlefishes, by discharging sepia from their
5486: ink-bags, are able to throw dust in the eyes of their enemies. Some
5488: game; some fishes, like the butterfish or gunnel, escape between stones
5489: where there seemed no opening and are almost uncatchable in their
5490: slipperiness. Subtlest of all, perhaps, is the habit some hermit-crabs
5492: with sea-anemones, which mask their bearers and also serve as mounted
5493: batteries, getting transport as their reward and likewise crumbs from
5494: the frequently spread table. But enough has been said to show that the
5498: Parental Care on the Shore
5500: According to Darwin, the struggle for existence, as a big fact in the
5501: economy of Animate Nature, includes not only competition but all the
5502: endeavours which secure the welfare of the offspring, and give them a
5506: itself to skate, places its egg-cocoons in the empty shell of a bivalve
5507: mollusc, and guards them for weeks, removing any mud that might injure
5508: their development. We have seen a British starfish with its fully-formed
5509: young ones creeping about on its body, though the usual mode of
5510: development for shore starfishes is that the young ones pass through a
5511: free-swimming larval period in the open water. The father sea-spider
5512: carries about the eggs attached to two of his limbs; the father
5513: sea-horse puts his mate's eggs into his breast pocket and carries them
5514: there in safety until they are hatched; the father stickleback of the
5515: shore-pools makes a seaweed nest and guards the eggs which his wives are
5516: induced to lay there; the father lumpsucker mounts guard over the bunch
5518: and drives off intruders with zest. He also aerates the developing eggs
5519: by frequent paddling with his pectoral fins and tail, as the Scots name
5520: Cock-paidle probably suggests. It is interesting that the salient
5521: examples of parental care in the shore-haunt are mostly on the male
5522: parent's side. But there is maternal virtue as well.
5527: The arms bear numerous prehensile suckers, which grip the prey. In the
5528: mouth there are strong jaws shaped like a parrot's beak. The

5563: The fauna of the shore is remarkably _representative_--from unicellular
5564: Protozoa to birds like the oyster-catcher and mammals like the seals.
5565: Almost all the great groups of animals have apparently served an
5566: apprenticeship in the shore-haunt, and since lessons learned for
5568: justifiable to look to the shore as a great school in which were gained
5574: In great contrast to the narrow, crowded, difficult conditions of the
5575: shore-haunt (littoral area) are the spacious, bountiful, and relatively
5576: easygoing conditions of the open sea (pelagic area), which means the
5578: have their maximum abundance at about fifty fathoms, so that the word
5580: fathoms, and the open sea, as a zoological haunt, stops with the light.
5581: It is hardly necessary to say that the pelagic plants are more abundant
5582: near the surface, and that below a certain depth the population consists
5583: almost exclusively of animals. Not a few of the animals sink and rise in
5584: the water periodically; there are some that come near the surface by
5585: day, and others that come near the surface by night. Of great interest
5586: is the habit of the extremely delicate Ctenophores or
5587: "sea-gooseberries," which the splash of a wave would tear into shreds.
5588: Whenever there is any hint of a storm they sink beyond its reach, and
5589: the ocean's surface must have remained flat as a mirror for many hours
5590: before they can be lured upwards from the calm of their deep retreat.
5595: To understand the vital economy of the open sea, we must recognise the
5596: incalculable abundance of minute unicellular plants, for they form the
5597: fundamental food-supply. Along with these must also be included numerous
5600: These green or greenish plants and animals are the _producers_, using
5601: the energy of the sunlight to help them in building up carbon compounds
5602: out of air, water, and salts. The animals which feed on the producers,
5603: or on other animals, are the _consumers_. Between the two come those
5605: plants or animals that other bacteria have rotted, into forms, e.g.
5606: nitrates, which plants can re-utilise. The importance of these
5607: _middlemen_ is great in keeping "the circulation of matter" agoing.

5624: indicus_--are related to the Angler of British coasts, but adapted to
5625: life in the great abysses. They are very dark in colour, and delicately
5626: built; they possess well-developed luminous organs. The third form is
5635: In the building of this egg depository, the male fish takes stones from
5636: the bottom of the stream, gripping them in his mouth, and heaps them up
5637: into the dam. In the egg depository he arranges the stones so that when

5644: The "floating sea-meadows," as Sir John Murray called them, are always
5645: receiving contributions from inshore waters, where the conditions are
5646: favourable for the prolific multiplication of unicellular Algæ, and
5647: there is also a certain amount of non-living sea-dust always being swept
5648: out from the seaweed and sea-grass area.
5653: The animals of the open sea are conveniently divided into the active
5654: swimmers (Nekton) and the more passive drifters (Plankton). The swimmers
5655: include whales great and small, such birds as the storm petrel, the
5657: the winged snails or sea-butterflies on which whalebone whales largely
5658: feed, some of the active cuttles or squids, various open-sea prawns and
5659: their relatives, some worms like the transparent arrow-worm, and such
5660: active Protozoa as Noctiluca, whose luminescence makes the waves sparkle
5661: in the short summer darkness. Very striking as an instance of the
5662: insurgence of life are the sea-skimmers (Halobatidæ), wingless insects
5663: related to the water-measurers in the ditch. They are found hundreds of
5664: miles from land, skimming on the surface of the open sea, and diving in
5665: stormy weather. They feed on floating dead animals.
5667: The drifters or easygoing swimmers--for there is no hard and fast
5668: line--are represented, for instance, by the flinty-shelled Radiolarians
5669: and certain of the chalk-forming animals (Globigerinid Foraminifera); by
5670: jellyfishes, swimming-bells, and Portuguese men-of-war; by the
5672: strange animals called Salps, related to the sedentary sea-squirts; and
5673: by some sluggish fishes like globe-fishes, which often float idly on the
5677: near that of the sea-water, with adaptations, such as projecting
5679: sinking according to the surrounding conditions. Many of them are
5680: luminescent, and many of them are very inconspicuous in the water owing
5681: to their transparency or their bluish colour. In both cases the
5687: Hunger is often very much in evidence in the open sea, especially in
5688: areas where the Plankton is poor. For there is great diversity in this
5689: respect, most of the Mediterranean, for instance, having a scanty
5690: Plankton as compared with the North Sea. In the South Pacific, west of
5691: Patagonia, there is said to be an immense "sea desert" where there is
5692: little Plankton, and therefore little in the way of fishes. The success
5693: of fisheries in the North, e.g. on the Atlantic cod-banks, is due to the
5694: richness of the floating sea-meadows and the abundance of the smaller
5695: constituents of the animal Plankton.
5697: Hunger is plain enough when the Baleen Whale rushes through the water
5698: with open jaws, engulfing in the huge cavern of its mouth, where the
5702: But there is love as well as hunger in the open sea. The maternal care
5703: exhibited by the whale reaches a very high level, and the delicate shell
5704: of the female Paper Nautilus or Argonaut, in which the eggs and the
5705: young ones are sheltered, may well be described as "the most beautiful
5706: cradle in the world."
5708: Besides the permanent inhabitants of the open sea, there are the larval
5709: stages of many shore-animals which are there only for a short time. For
5710: there is an interesting give and take between the shore-haunt and the
5711: open sea. From the shore come nutritive contributions and minute
5712: organisms which multiply quickly in the open waters. But not less
5713: important is the fact that the open waters afford a safe cradle or
5715: acorn-shell and sea-urchin, which could not survive for a day in the
5716: rough-and-tumble conditions of the shore and the shallow water. After
5717: undergoing radical changes and gaining strength, the young creatures
5718: return to the shore in various ways.
5723: Very different from all the other haunts are the depths of the sea,
5724: including the floor of the abysses and the zones of water near the
5725: bottom. This haunt, forever unseen, occupies more than a third of the
5727: in connection with the mending of telegraph cables, but the results of
5728: the _Challenger_ expedition (1873-6) gave the first impressive picture
5734: The average depth of the ocean is about two and a half miles; therefore,
5735: since many parts are relatively shallow, there must be enormous depths.
5736: A few of these, technically called "deeps," are about six miles deep, in
5738: such depths; even at 2,500 fathoms it is two and a half tons on the
5739: square inch. The temperature is on and off the freezing-point of fresh
5740: water (28°-34° Fahr.), due to the continual sinking down of cold water
5741: from the Poles, especially from the South. Apart from the fitful gleams
5742: of luminescent animals, there is utter darkness in the deep waters. The
5746: silence, and there is no scenery on the floor. A deep, cold, dark,
5752: While some parts of the floor of the abysses are more thickly peopled
5753: than others, there is no depth limit to the distribution of life.
5754: Wherever the long arm of the dredge has reached, animals have been
5757: very representative fauna. In the absence of light there can be no
5758: chlorophyll-possessing plants, and as the animals cannot all be eating
5759: one another there must be an extraneous source of food-supply. This is
5760: found in the sinking down of minute organisms which are killed on the
5761: surface by changes of temperature and other causes. What is left of
5762: them, before or after being swallowed, and of sea-dust and mineral
5763: particles of various kinds forms the diversified "ooze" of the
5764: sea-floor, a soft muddy precipitate, which is said to have in places the
5765: consistence of butter in summer weather.
5767: There seems to be no bacteria in the abysses, so there can be no
5768: rotting. Everything that sinks down, even the huge carcase of a whale,
5769: must be nibbled away by hungry animals and digested, or else, in the
5770: case of most bones, slowly dissolved away. Of the whale there are left
5771: only the ear-bones, of the shark his teeth.
5776: In adaptation to the great pressure the bodies of deep-sea animals are
5777: usually very permeable, so that the water gets through and through them,
5778: as in the case of Venus' Flower Basket, a flinty sponge which a child's
5779: finger would shiver. But when the pressure inside is the same as that
5780: outside nothing happens. In adaptation to the treacherous ooze, so apt
5781: to smother, many of the active deep-sea animals have very long,
5782: stilt-like legs, and many of the sedentary types are lifted into safety
5783: on the end of long stalks which have their bases embedded in the mud. In
5784: adaptation to the darkness, in which there is only luminescence that
5785: eyes could use, there is a great development of tactility. The
5788: As to the origin of the deep-sea fauna, there seems no doubt that it
5789: has arisen by many contributions from the various shore-haunts.
5790: Following the down-drifting food, many shore-animals have in the course
5791: of many generations reached the world of eternal night and winter, and
5792: become adapted to its strange conditions. For the animals of the

5817: except to nest. It is the smallest web-footed bird, about four inches
5818: long. The legs are long and often touch the water as the bird flies. The
5819: storm petrel is at home in the Atlantic, and often nests on islands off
5820: the west coast of Britain.]
5825: Of the whole earth's surface the freshwaters form a very small fraction,
5826: about a hundredth, but they make up for their smallness by their
5827: variety. We think of deep lake and shallow pond, of the great river and
5828: the purling brook, of lagoon and swamp, and more besides. There is a
5829: striking resemblance in the animal population of widely separated
5831: creatures on their muddy feet from one water-shed to another; partly
5832: because some of the freshwater animals are descended from types which
5833: make their way from the sea and the seashore through estuaries and
5834: marshes, and only certain kinds of constitution could survive the
5836: of ancient seas, and similar forms again would survive the change.
5839: like Amoebæ and the Bell-Animalcules, a representative of one family
5840: of sponges (Spongillidæ), the common Hydra, many unsegmented worms
5841: (notably Planarians and Nematodes), many Annelids related to the
5844: warm countries a huge Crocodilian, various interesting birds like the
5845: water-ouzel or dipper, and mammals like the water-vole and the
5848: Freshwater animals have to face certain difficulties, the greatest of
5850: There is no more interesting study in the world than an inquiry into the
5851: adaptations by which freshwater animals overcome the difficulties of the
5854: (1) Drought is circumvented by the capacity that many freshwater animals
5855: have of lying low and saying nothing. Thus the African mudfish may spend
5856: half the year encased in the mud, and many minute crustaceans can
5857: survive being dried up for years. (2) Escape from the danger of being
5858: frozen hard in the pool is largely due to the almost unique property of
5859: water that it expands as it approaches the freezing-point. Thus the
5860: colder water rises to the surface and forms or adds to the protecting
5861: blanket of ice. The warmer water remains unfrozen at the bottom, and the
5862: animals live on. (3) The risk of being washed away, e.g. to the sea, is
5864: and by shortening the juvenile stages when the risks are greatest.
5869: Over and over again in the history of animal life there have been
5870: attempts to get out of the water on to terra firma, and many of these
5874: In thinking of the conquest of the dry land by animals, we must
5875: recognise the indispensable rôle of plants in preparing the way. The dry
5877: begun to establish themselves, affording food, shelter, and humidity.
5878: There had to be plants before there could be earthworms, which feed on
5879: decaying leaves and the like, but how soon was the debt repaid when the
5880: earthworms began their worldwide task of forming vegetable mould,
5881: opening up the earth with their burrows, circulating the soil by means
5882: of their castings, and bruising the particles in their
5883: gizzard--certainly the most important mill in the world.
5885: Another important idea is that littoral haunts, both on the seashore and
5886: in the freshwaters, afforded the necessary apprenticeship and
5887: transitional experience for the more strenuous life on dry land. Much
5888: that was perfected on land had its beginnings on the shore. Let us
5889: inquire, however, what the passage from water to dry land actually
5891: Evolution), but the subject is one of great interest and importance.
5894: Difficulties and Results of the Transition from Water to Land
5896: Leaving the water for dry land implied a loss in freedom of movement,
5897: for the terrestrial animal is primarily restricted to the surface of the
5899: very precise, needs with which we may associate the acquisition of fine
5900: cross-striped, quickly contracting muscles, and also, in time, their
5902: fifty-four muscles in the half-second that elapses between raising the
5903: heel of our foot in walking and planting it firmly on the ground again.
5904: Moreover, the need for rapid precisely controlled movements implied an
5905: improved nervous system, for the brain was a movement-controlling organ
5906: for ages before it did much in the way of thinking. The transition to
5907: terra firma also involved a greater compactness of body, so that there
5908: should not be too great friction on the surface. An animal like the
5909: jellyfish is unthinkable on land, and the elongated bodies of some land
5910: animals like centipedes and snakes are specially adapted so that they do
5911: not "sprawl." They are exceptions that prove the rule.
5913: Getting on to dry land meant entering a kingdom where the differences
5915: the sea. This made it advantageous to have protections against
5916: evaporation and loss of heat and other such dangers. Hence a variety of
5917: ways in which the surface of the body acquired a thickened skin, or a
5919: cases there is an increase of the protection before the winter sets in,
5920: e.g. by growing thicker fur or by accumulating a layer of fat below the
5923: But the thickening or protection of the skin involved a partial or total
5924: loss of the skin as a respiratory surface. There is more oxygen
5925: available on dry land than in the water, but it is not so readily
5926: captured. Thus we see the importance of moist internal surfaces for
5927: capturing the oxygen which has been drawn into the interior of the body
5930: where the air is carried to every hole and corner of the body by a
5931: ramifying system of air-tubes or tracheæ. In most animals the blood goes
5932: to the air, in insects the air goes to the blood. In the Robber-Crab,
5933: which has migrated from the shore inland, the dry air is absorbed by
5934: vascular tufts growing under the shelter of the gill-cover.
5937: difficult on land than in the water. For the water offers an immediate
5938: cradle, whereas on the dry land there were many dangers, e.g. of
5941: animals hide their eggs or their young ones in holes and nests, on herbs
5942: and on trees. Some carry their young ones about after they are born,
5943: like the Surinam toad and the kangaroo, while others have prolonged the
5944: period of ante-natal life during which the young ones develop in safety
5945: within their mother, and in very intimate partnership with her in the
5946: case of the placental mammals. It is very interesting to find that the
5947: pioneer animal called Peripatus, which bridges the gap between worms and
5950: Enough has been said to show that the successive conquests of the dry
5952: the invasion which the Amphibians led was the beginning of better
5960: famous for its extraordinary power of "sailing" round the ship without
5967: their adult life in the free air, and the swift hardly pauses in its
5968: flight from dawn to dusk of the long summer day, alighting only for
5969: brief moments at the nest to deliver insects to the young. All the
5972: The air was the last haunt of life to be conquered, and it is
5973: interesting to inquire what the conquest implied. (1) It meant
5974: transcending the radical difficulty of terrestrial life which confines
5975: the creatures of the dry land to moving on one plane, the surface of the
5976: earth. But the power of flight brought its possessors back to the
5978: sparrow rise into the air just as the cat has completed her stealthy
5980: The power of flight also opened up new possibilities of following the
5982: great importance too was the practicability of placing the eggs and the
5984: When one thinks of it, the rooks' nests swaying on the tree-tops express
5985: the climax of a brilliant experiment. (4) The crowning advantage was the
5986: possibility of migrating, of conquering time (by circumventing the arid
5987: summer and the severe winter) and of conquering space (by passing
5988: quickly from one country to another and sometimes almost girdling the
5989: globe). There are not many acquisitions that have meant more to their
5990: possessors than the power of flight. It was a key opening the doors of a
5994: solved four times, and the solution has been different in each case. The
5996: birds, and bats. Moreover, as has been pointed out, there have been
5997: numerous attempts at flight which remain glorious failures, notably the
5998: flying fishes, which take a great leap and hold their pectoral fins
5999: taut; the Flying Tree-Toad, whose webbed fingers and toes form a
6000: parachute; the Flying Lizard (_Draco volans_), which has its skin pushed
6005: The wings of an insect are hollow flattened sacs which grow out from the
6006: upper parts of the sides of the second and third rings of the region
6007: called the thorax. They are worked by powerful muscles, and are
6010: built and very perfectly aerated, and the principle of the insect's
6011: flight is the extremely rapid striking of the air by means of the
6013: of its wings in one _second_. Hence, in many cases, the familiar hum,
6014: comparable on a small scale to that produced by the rapidly revolving
6016: outfly a pigeon, but few insects can fly far, and they are easily blown
6017: away or blown back by the wind. Dragon-flies and bees may be cited as
6019: exceptional, and the usual shortness of insect flight is an important
6020: fact for man since it limits the range of insects like house-flies and
6024: It is interesting to notice that some insects only fly once in their
6025: lifetime, namely, in connection with mating. The evolution of the
6027: could run, leap, and parachute before they could actually fly.
6029: The extinct Flying Dragons or Pterodactyls had their golden age in the
6030: Cretaceous era, after which they disappeared, leaving no descendants. A
6031: fold of skin was spread out from the sides of the body by the enormously
6033: little finger); it was continued to the hind-legs and thence to the
6036: It is unlikely that the Pterodactyls could fly far, for they have at
6037: most a weak keel on their breast-bone; on the other hand, some of them
6039: have served as a firm fulcrum for the stroke of the wings. The quaint
6040: creatures varied from the size of a sparrow up to a magnificent spread
6041: of 15-20 feet from tip to tip of the wings. They were the largest of all
6044: The bird's solution of the problem of flight, which will be discussed
6045: separately, is centred in the feather, which forms a coherent vane for
6046: striking the air. In Pterodactyl and bat the wing is a web-wing or
6047: patagium, and a small web is to be seen on the front side of the bird's
6048: wing. But the bird's patagium is unimportant, and the bird's wing is on
6049: an evolutionary tack of its own--a fore-limb transformed for bearing the
6050: feathers of flight. Feathers are in a general way comparable to the
6052: is known between the two. Birds evolved from a bipedal Dinosaur stock,
6053: as has been noticed already, and it is highly probable that they began
6054: their ascent by taking running leaps along the ground, flapping their
6055: scaly fore-limbs, and balancing themselves in kangaroo-like fashion with
6057: apprenticeship, during which they made a fine art of parachuting--a
6058: persistence of which is to be seen in the pigeon "gliding" from the
6059: dovecot to the ground. It is in birds that the mastery of the air
6060: reaches its climax, and the mysterious "sailing" of the albatross and
6061: the vulture is surely the most remarkable locomotor triumph that has
6062: ever been achieved. Without any apparent stroke of the wings, the bird
6063: sails for half an hour at a time with the wind and against the wind,
6064: around the ship and in majestic spirals in the sky, probably taking
6070: The web-wing of bats involves much more than the fore-arm. The double
6071: fold of skin begins on the side of the neck, passes along the front of
6072: the arm, skips the thumb, and is continued over the elongated palm-bones
6073: and fingers to the sides of the body again, and to the hind-legs, and to
6074: the tail if there is a tail. It is interesting to find that the bones of
6075: the bat's skeleton tend to be lightly built as in birds, that the
6076: breast-bone has likewise a keel for the better insertion of the pectoral
6077: muscles, and that there is a solidifying of the vertebræ of the back,
6078: affording as in birds a firm basis for the wing action. Such similar
6080: one another, are called "convergences," and form a very interesting
6081: study. In addition to adaptations which the bat shares with the flying
6082: bird, it has many of its own. There are so many nerve-endings on the
6083: wing, and often also on special skin-leaves about the ears and nose,
6084: that the bat flying in the dusk does not knock against branches or other
6085: obstacles. Some say that it is helped by the echoes of its high-pitched
6086: voice, but there is no doubt as to its exquisite tactility. That it
6088: to flight, and similarly the sharp, mountain-top-like cusps on the back
6091: Whether we think of the triumphant flight of birds, reaching a climax in
6092: migration, or of the marvel that a creature of the earth--as a mammal
6093: essentially is--should evolve such a mastery of the air as we see in
6094: bats, or even of the repeated but splendid failures which parachuting
6095: animals illustrate, we gain an impression of the insurgence of living
6096: creatures in their characteristic endeavour after fuller well-being.
6099: the particular difficulties of the haunt which they tenant. But
6101: follows on another. It is natural, therefore, to pass to the frequent
6102: occurrence of protective resemblance, camouflage, and mimicry--the
6103: subject of the next article.

6143: reason why it is so common is because the struggle for existence is
6144: often very keen, and the reasons why the struggle for existence is keen
6145: are four. First, there is the tendency to over-population in many
6146: animals, especially those of low degree. Second, there is the fact that

6148: incarnations, one animal depending upon another for food, and all in the

6152: changefulness of the physical environment, which forces animals to
6153: answer back or die; but the first three reasons have most to do with the
6157: Our problem is the evolution of elusiveness, so far at least as that
6158: depends on likeness to surroundings, on protective resemblance to other
6165: seen in some lizards and snakes. The green lizard is like the grass and
6166: the green tree-snake is inconspicuous among the branches. The spotted
6167: leopard is suited to the interrupted light of the forest, and it is
6168: sometimes hard to tell where the jungle ends and the striped tiger

6178: of 300 chickens in a field, 240 white or black and therefore
6180: crows, but only one of these was spotted. This was not the proportion
6181: that there should have been if the mortality had been fortuitous. There
6183: surroundings, like a little piece of scenery if the animal is not
6185: the safest coloration will be wiped out in the course of Nature's
6188: But we must not be credulous, and there are three cautions to be borne
6189: in mind. (1) An animal may be very like its surroundings without there
6190: being any protection implied. The arrow-worms in the sea are as clear as
6191: glass, and so are many open-sea animals. But this is because their
6192: tissues are so watery, with a specific gravity near that of the salt
6193: water. And the invisibility does not save them, always or often, from
6194: being swallowed by larger animals that gather the harvest of the sea.
6195: (2) Among the cleverer animals it looks as if the creature sometimes
6197: itself in the middle of a little patch of lichen, where its
6199: safer to rest in surroundings the general colour of which is like that
6200: of the animal's body. (3) The fishes that live among the coral-reefs are
6201: startling in their brilliant coloration, and there are many different
6202: patterns. To explain this it has been suggested that these fishes are so
6203: safe among the mazy passages and endless nooks of the reefs, that they
6204: can well afford to wear any colour that suits their constitution. In
6206: suit and walked about among the coral have told us that each kind of
6208: suited for midday work and others for evening work. Sometimes there is a
6210: the same corner at different times.
6215: its formidable forelegs as if in the attitude of prayer; its movements
6216: are very slow and stealthy; and there is a suggestion of a leaf in the
6217: forewing. But there is no reason to credit the creature with conscious
6224: winter and inconspicuous against the snow. But the white dress is also
6225: the dress that is physiologically best, for it loses least of the animal
6230: The monitors are the largest of existing lizards, the Australian species
6231: represented in the photograph attaining a length of four feet. It has a
6233: conspicuous against certain backgrounds, such as the bark of a tree.]
6242: so forth, and it is often in admirable adjustment to the colour of the
6244: shown that when the crab has moulted, which it has to do very often when
6245: it is young, the colour of the new shell tends to harmonise with the
6246: general colour of the rocks and seaweed. How this is brought about, we
6247: do not know. The colour does not seem to change till the next moult, and
6248: not then unless there is some reason for it. A full-grown shore-crab is
6250: therefore, that the variety of coloration is mainly among the small
6252: possible, moreover, that the resemblance to the surroundings admits of
6253: more successful hunting, enabling the small crab to take its victim
6256: Professor Poulton's experiments with the caterpillars of the small
6257: tortoise-shell butterfly showed that in black surroundings the pupæ tend
6259: the same is true in other cases. It appears that the surrounding colour
6260: affects the caterpillars through the skin during a sensitive period--the
6261: twenty hours immediately preceding the last twelve hours of the larval
6262: state. The result will tend to make the quiescent pupæ less conspicuous
6263: during the critical time of metamorphosis. The physiology of this
6264: sympathetic colouring remains obscure.
6269: The ptarmigan moults three times in the year. Its summer plumage is
6270: rather grouselike above, with a good deal of rufous brown; the back
6271: becomes much more grey in autumn; almost all the feathers of the winter
6272: plumage are white. That is to say, they develop without any pigment and
6273: with numerous gas-bubbles in their cells. Now there can be no doubt that
6274: this white winter plumage makes the ptarmigan very inconspicuous amidst
6275: the snow. Sometimes one comes within a few feet of the crouching bird
6276: without seeing it, and this garment of invisibility may save it from the
6279: Similarly the brown stoat becomes the white ermine, mainly by the
6280: growth, of a new suit of white fur, and the same is true of the mountain
6281: hare. The ermine is all white except the black tip of its tail; the
6282: mountain hare in its winter dress is all white save the black tips of
6283: its ears. In some cases, especially in the mountain hare, it seems that
6285: man. According to Metchnikoff, the wandering amoeboid cells of the
6286: body, called phagocytes, may creep up into the hairs and come back again
6287: with microscopic burdens of pigment. The place of the pigment is taken
6288: by gas-bubbles, and that is what causes the whiteness. In no animals is
6289: there any white _pigment_; the white _colour_ is like that of snow or
6290: foam, it is due to the complete reflection of the light from innumerable
6300: an advertisement, impressing other creatures with the fact that the
6308: The upper photograph shows the Warty Chameleon inflated and conspicuous.
6309: At another time, however, with compressed body and adjusted coloration,
6310: the animal is very inconspicuous. The lower photograph shows the sudden
6311: protrusion of the very long tongue on a fly.]
6317: inconspicuous in their coloration when seen in their natural
6320: The mountain hare may escape the fox the more readily because its
6322: yet, at other times, we have seen the creature standing out like a
6323: target on the dark moorland. So it cuts both ways. The ermine has almost
6324: no enemies except the gamekeeper, but its winter whiteness may help it
6325: to sneak upon its victims, such as grouse or rabbit, when there is snow
6326: upon the ground. In both cases, however, the probability is that the
6329: that for a warm-blooded creature, whether bird or mammal, the
6330: physiologically best dress is a white one, for there is less radiation
6331: of the precious animal heat from white plumage or white pelage than from
6332: any other colour. The quality of warm-bloodedness is a prerogative of
6333: birds and mammals, and it means that the body keeps an almost constant
6335: automatic internal adjustments which regulate the supply of heat,
6336: chiefly from the muscles, to the loss of heat, chiefly through the skin
6337: and from the lungs. The chief importance of this internal heat is that
6338: it facilitates the smooth continuance of the chemical processes on which
6339: life depends. If the temperature falls, as in hibernating mammals (whose
6340: warm-bloodedness is imperfect), the rate of the vital process is slowed
6341: down--sometimes dangerously. Thus we see how the white coat helps the
6342: life of the creature.
6350: adjusting their hue and pattern to the surrounding gravel and sand, so
6351: that it is difficult to find them even when we know that they are there.
6352: It must be admitted that they are also very quick to get a sprinkling
6353: of sand over their upturned side, so that only the eyes are left
6354: showing. But there is no doubt as to the exactness with which they often
6355: adjust themselves to be like a little piece of the substratum on which
6356: they lie; they will do this within limits in experimental conditions
6357: when they are placed on a quite artificial floor. As these fishes are
6359: and otters, it is highly probably that their power of self-effacement
6360: often saves their life. And it may be effected within a few minutes, in
6363: In these self-effacing flat-fishes we know with some precision what
6364: happens. The adjustment of colour and pattern is due to changes in the
6366: the skin. But what makes the pigment-cells change? The fact that a blind
6367: flat-fish does not change its colour gives us the first part of the
6368: answer. The colour and the pattern of the surroundings must affect the
6369: eye. The message travels by the optic nerve to the brain; from the
6370: brain, instead of passing down the spinal cord, the message travels down
6371: the chain of sympathetic ganglia. From these it passes along the nerves
6372: which comes out of the spinal cord and control the skin. Thus the
6373: message reaches the colour-cells in the skin, and before you have
6374: carefully read these lines the flat-fish has slipped on its Gyges ring
6379: to conceal. It occurs with much subtlety in the Æsop prawn, Hippolyte,
6383:     According to the nature of the background, [Professor Gamble writes]
6384:     so is the mixture of the pigments compounded so as to form a close
6385:     reproduction both of its colour and its pattern. A sweep of the
6386:     shrimp net detaches a battalion of these sleeping prawns, and if
6387:     we turn the motley into a dish and give a choice of seaweed, each
6388:     variety after its kind will select the one with which it agrees in
6389:     colour, and vanish. Both when young and when full-grown, the Æsop
6390:     prawn takes on the colour of its immediate surroundings. At
6393:     the least tremor it leaps violently, and often swims actively from
6394:     one food-plant to another. This blue fit lasts till daybreak, and is
6395:     then succeeded by the prawn's diurnal tint.
6397: Thus, Professor Gamble continues, the colour of an animal may express a
6406: is about twice the length of its body. The tongue can be quickly coiled
6407: up and put safely away beneath the lower part of the head.]
6413: The soft browns and blue-greens harmonise with the dull sheaths of the
6414: young reeds; the nestling bittern is thus completely camouflaged.]
6420: and the finest exhibition of it is among the chameleons. These quaint
6421: creatures are characteristic of Africa; but they occur also in
6422: Andalusia, Arabia, Ceylon, and Southern India. They are adapted for life
6423: on trees, where they hunt insects with great deliberateness and success.
6425: about seven inches in the common chameleon. Their hands and feet are
6426: split so that they grip the branches firmly, and the prehensile tail
6427: rivals a monkey's. When they wish they can make themselves very slim,
6428: contracting the body from side to side, so that they are not very
6429: readily seen. In other circumstances, however, they do not practise
6430: self-effacement, but the very reverse. They inflate their bodies, having
6431: not only large lungs, but air-sacs in connection with them. The throat
6432: bulges; the body sways from side to side; and the creature expresses its
6434: depends partly on the contraction and expansion of the colour-cells
6435: (chromatophores) in the under-skin (or dermis) and partly on
6437: guanin. The repertory of possible colours in the common chameleon is
6438: greater than in any other animal except the Æsop prawn. There is a
6441: tartan; and there is no doubt that one and the same animal has a wide
6446: changing its colour, being affected by the play of light on its eyes. A
6448: illumined green leaves. But the colour also changes with the time of day
6449: and with the animal's moods. A sudden irritation may bring about a rapid
6450: change; in other cases the transformation comes about very gradually.
6451: When the colour-change expresses the chameleon's feelings it might be
6452: compared to blushing, but that is due to an expansion of the arteries of
6453: the face, allowing more blood to get into the capillaries of the
6454: under-skin. The case of the chameleon is peculiarly interesting because
6455: the animal has two kinds of tactics--self-effacement on the one hand and
6456: bluffing on the other. There can be little doubt that the power of
6459: "turned round and opened its great pink mouth in the face of the
6460: advancing dog, at the same time rapidly changing colour, becoming almost
6461: black. This ruse succeeded every time, the dog turning off at once." In
6462: natural leafy surroundings the startling effect would be much greater--a
6463: sudden throwing off of the mantle of invisibility and the exposure of a

6477: Instantaneously he got a characteristic sharp nip; it was the spider
6478: after all! Here the colour-resemblance was enhanced by a

6497: because it thereby escapes attention; but there is another possibility.
6499: to excrementitious material, and the spider Dr. Forbes observed had
6503: on sand, and caught a blue butterfly which came to feed there!
6505: Some of the walking-stick insects, belonging to the order of crickets
6506: and grasshoppers (Orthoptera), have their body elongated and narrow,
6507: like a thin dry branch, and they have a way of sticking out their limbs
6508: at abrupt and diverse angles, which makes the resemblance to twigs very
6509: close indeed. Some of these quaint insects rest through the day and have
6510: the remarkable habit of putting themselves into a sort of kataleptic
6511: state. Many creatures turn stiff when they get a shock, or pass suddenly
6512: into new surroundings, like some of the sand-hoppers when we lay them on
6513: the palm of our hand; but these twig-insects put themselves into this
6515: and then it stiffens. An advantage may be that even if they were
6516: surprised by a bird or a lizard, they will not be able to betray
6517: themselves by even a tremor. Disguise is perfected by a remarkable
6520: value. The top end of the series is seen when a fox plays 'possum.
6523: surface, is like a withered leaf when it settles down and shows the
6524: under side of its wings. Here, again, there is precise form-resemblance,
6525: for the nervures on the wings are like the mid-rib and side veins on a
6526: leaf, and the touch of perfection is given in the presence of whitish
6527: spots which look exactly like the discolorations produced by lichens on
6530: superfluous twig, for many brownish caterpillars fasten themselves by
6531: their posterior claspers and by an invisible thread of silk from their
6532: mouth, and project from the branch at a twig-like angle. An insect may
6533: be the very image of a sharp prickle or a piece of soft moss; a spider
6535: one of the sea-horses (_Phyllopteryx_) has frond-like tassels on various
6536: parts of its body, so that it looks extraordinarily like the seaweeds
6539: else seek out a position where this resemblance tells, and there is
6545: Mimicry in the True Sense
6547: It sometimes happens that in one and the same place there are two groups
6548: of animals not very nearly related which are "doubles" of one another.
6549: Investigation shows that the members of the one group, _always in the
6551: unpalatable. They are the "mimicked." The members of the other group,
6552: _always in the minority_, have not got the special protection possessed
6553: by the others. They are the "mimickers," though the resemblance is not,
6554: of course, associated with any conscious imitation. The theory is that
6555: the mimickers live on the reputation of the mimicked. If the mimicked
6556: are left alone by birds because they have a reputation for
6557: unpalatability, or because they are able to sting, the mimickers
6558: survive--although they are palatable and stingless. They succeed, not
6559: through any virtue of their own, but because of their resemblance to the
6560: mimicked, for whom they are mistaken. There are many cases of mimetic
6562: that the thing works; there are other cases which are rather
6563: far-fetched, and may be somewhat of the nature of coincidences. Thus
6567: forthcoming for some, namely, experimental evidence, e.g. that the
6570: show that the mimickers do actually consort with the mimicked. Some
6572: advantage; the common drone-fly is superficially like a small bee; some
6574: maintained that the powerful "friar-birds" of the Far East are mimicked
6575: by the weak and timid orioles. When the model is unpalatable or
6576: repulsive or dangerous, and the mimic the reverse, the mimicry is called
6577: "Batesian" (after Mr. Bates), but there is another kind of mimicry
6578: called Müllerian (after Fritz Müller) where the mimic is also
6579: unpalatable. The theory in this case is that the mimicry serves as
6580: mutual assurance, the members of the ring getting on better by
6581: consistently presenting the same appearance, which has come to mean to
6583: is nothing out of the question in this theory, but it requires to be
6585: which are the very opposite of the disguises which we are now studying.
6587: coloured tree-frogs are obtrusive rather than elusive, and the theory
6588: of Alfred Russel Wallace was that the flaunting conspicuousness serves
6589: as a useful advertisement, impressing itself on the memories of

6599: The colouring of the under surface of the wings is like that of the

6622: tentacles can sting. As for the sea-anemones, they are carried about by

6625: eating at the same table.]

6632: young frog-hopper makes, and within which it lies safe both from the

6634: the cuckoo-spit, the frog-hopper becomes a winged insect.]
6640: when the advancing troop masked their approach by cutting down branches
6641: of the trees, has had its counterpart in many countries. But it is also
6642: enacted on the seashore. There are many kinds of crabs that put on
6644: piece of seaweed, nibbles at the end of it, and then rubs it on the back
6645: of the carapace or on the legs so that it fixes to the bristles. As the
6646: seaweed continues to live, the crab soon has a little garden on its back
6647: which masks the crab's real nature. It is most effective camouflaging,
6648: but if the crab continues to grow it has to moult, and that means losing
6649: the disguise. It is then necessary to make a new one. The crab must have
6650: on the shore something corresponding to a reputation; that is to say,
6651: other animals are clearly or dimly aware that the crab is a voracious
6652: and combative creature. How useful to the crab, then, to have its
6654: zoophyte. It will enable the creature to sneak upon its victims or to
6655: escape the attention of its own enemies.
6658: clothe itself again, the habit has become instinctive; and it must be
6664: with flinty needles; another cuts off the tunic of a sea-squirt and
6665: throws it over its shoulders; another trundles about a bivalve shell.
6666: The facts recall the familiar case of the hermit-crab, which protects
6667: its soft tail by tucking it into the empty shell of a periwinkle or a
6668: whelk or some other sea-snail, and that case leads on to the elaboration
6669: known as commensalism, where the hermit-crab fixes sea-anemones on the
6671: masking, for the sea-anemone can sting, which is a useful quality in a
6672: partner. That this second advantage may become the main one is evident
6673: in several cases where the sea-anemone is borne, just like a weapon, on
6674: each of the crustacean's great claws. Moreover, as the term commensalism
6675: (eating at the same table) suggests, the partnership is _mutually_
6676: beneficial. For the sea-anemone is carried about by the hermit-crab, and
6678: There is a very interesting sidelight on the mutual benefit in the case
6679: of a dislodged sea-anemone which sulked for a while and then waited in a
6681: Whereupon the sea-anemone gripped and slowly worked itself up on to the
6682: back of the shell.
6687: Other Kinds of Elusiveness
6690: troop of cuttlefish swimming in the sea is a beautiful sight. They keep
6691: time with one another in their movements and they show the same change
6692: of colour almost at the same moment. They are suddenly attacked,
6693: however, by a small shark, and then comes a simultaneous discharge of
6694: sepia from their ink-bags. There are clouds of ink in the clear water,
6695: for, as Professor Hickson puts it, the cuttlefishes have thrown dust in
6696: the eyes of their enemies. One can see a newborn cuttlefish do this a
6697: minute after it escapes from the egg.
6699: Very beautiful is the way in which many birds, like our common
6700: chaffinch, disguise the outside of their nest with moss and lichen and
6701: other trifles felted together, so that the cradle is as inconspicuous as
6703: spider's web on the outside of a nest!
6705: How curious is the case of the tree-sloth of South American forests,
6706: that walks slowly, back downwards, along the undersides of the branches,
6708: animal, and therefore not in special danger, but when resting during the
6710: lichens and other growths on the branches. But the protective
6711: resemblance is enhanced by the presence of a green alga, which actually
6712: lives on the surface of the sloth's hairs--an alga like the one that
6713: makes tree-stems and gate-posts green in damp weather.
6715: There is no commoner sight in the early summer than the cuckoo-spit on
6716: the grasses and herbage by the wayside. It is conspicuous and yet it is
6718: must be a disguise. It is a sort of soap made by the activity of small
6719: frog-hoppers while they are still in the wingless larval stage, before
6720: they begin to hop. The insect pierces with its sharp mouth-parts the
6721: skin of the plant and sucks in sweet sap which by and by overflows over
6723: which mixes with the sugary sap, reminding one of how "whipped egg" is
6724: made. But along with the sugary sap and the air, there is a little
6725: ferment from the food-canal and a little wax from glands on the skin,
6726: and the four things mixed together make a kind of soap which lasts
6727: through the heat of the day.
6729: There are many other modes of disguise besides those which we have been
6730: able to illustrate. Indeed, the biggest fact is that there are so many,
6731: for it brings us back to the idea that life is not an easy business. It
6733: their condition; perhaps it is true, as he says, that not one is
6734: unhappy over the whole earth. But there is another truth, that this
6735: world is not a place for the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin, and that
6737: some path of safety or go back. One of these paths of safety is
6756: puny infant, and no one should think less of the human race because it
6758: apartness from the rest of creation when he is seen at his best--"a
6759: little lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour." "What a
6762: in apprehension so like a God." Nevertheless, all the facts point to his
6763: affiliation to the stock to which monkeys and apes also belong. Not,
6765: rather that he and they have sprung from a common ancestry--are branches
6766: of the same stem. This conclusion is so momentous that the reasons for
6774: The anatomical structure of man is closely similar to that of the
6775: anthropoid apes--the gorilla, the orang, the chimpanzee, and the gibbon.
6777: for nerve, man and ape agree. As the conservative anatomist, Sir
6778: Richard Owen, said, there is between them "an all-pervading similitude
6779: of structure." Differences, of course, there are, but they are not
6781: that of a gorilla. The average human brain weighs about 48 ounces; the
6782: gorilla brain does not exceed 20 ounces at its best. The capacity of the
6783: human skull is never less than 55 cubic inches; in the orang and the
6784: chimpanzee the figures are 26 and 27-1/2 respectively. We are not
6785: suggesting that the most distinctive features of man are such as can be
6786: measured and weighed, but it is important to notice that the main seat
6787: of his mental powers is physically far ahead of that of the highest of
6788: the anthropoid apes.
6791: weighted with the heavy brain does not droop forward as the ape's does;
6792: with his erect attitude there is perhaps to be associated his more
6796: almost unique in having a chin. Man plants the sole of his foot flat on
6797: the ground, his big toe is usually in a line with the other toes, and he
6798: has a better heel than any monkey has. The change in the shape of the
6799: head is to be thought of in connection with the enlargement of the
6800: brain, and also in connection with the natural reduction of the muzzle
6801: region when the hand was freed from being an organ of support and became
6802: suited for grasping the food and conveying it to the mouth.
6804: Everyone is familiar in man's clothing with traces of the past
6805: persisting in the present, though their use has long since disappeared.
6806: There are buttons on the back of the waist of the morning coat to which
6807: the tails of the coat used to be fastened up, and there are buttons,
6808: occasionally with buttonholes, at the wrist which were once useful in
6809: turning up the sleeve. The same is true of man's body, which is a
6811: over a hundred of these _vestigial_ structures, and though this number
6812: is perhaps too high, there is no doubt that the list is long. In the
6813: inner upper corner of the eye there is a minute tag--but larger in some
6814: races than in others--which is the last dwindling relic of the third
6815: eyelid, used in cleaning the front of the eye, which most mammals
6818: useless vestige, and the dwindling must be associated with the fact that
6819: the upper eyelid is much more mobile in man and monkeys than in the
6820: other mammals. The vestigial third eyelid in man is enough of itself to
6821: prove his relationship with the mammals, but it is only one example out
6822: of many. Some of these are discussed in the article dealing with the
6823: human body, but we may mention the vestigial muscles going to the
6824: ear-trumpet, man's dwindling counterpart of the skin-twitching muscle
6825: which we see a horse use when he jerks a fly off his flanks, and the
6826: short tail which in the seven-weeks-old human embryo is actually longer
6827: than the leg. Without committing ourselves to a belief in the entire
6828: uselessness of the vermiform appendix, which grows out as a blind alley
6829: at the junction of the small intestine with the large, we are safe in
6830: saying that it is a dwindling structure--the remains of a blind gut

6833: body, and bears the vermiform appendix at its far end. In man the

6836: is very variable, as dwindling structures tend to be. One of the
6837: unpleasant expressions of this variability is the liability to go wrong:
6838: hence appendicitis. Now these vestigial structures are, as Darwin said,
6839: like the unsounded, i.e. functionless, letters in words, such as the _o_
6840: in "leopard," the _b_ in "doubt," the _g_ in "reign." They are of no
6841: use, but they tell us something of the history of the words. So do man's
6843: or evolutionary significance. No other interpretation is possible.

6907: is an harmonious mingling of the two. This is a very literal
6908: demonstration of man's blood-relationship with the higher apes. But

6913: anthropoid ape. But when it is mingled with the blood of an American
6914: monkey there is only a slight clouding after a considerable time and
6915: no actual precipitate. When it is added to the blood of one of the
6916: distantly related "half-monkeys" or lemurs there is no reaction or only
6917: a very weak one. With the blood of mammals off the simian line

6921: degree of relationship with the different main groups of apes can be

6937: months of ante-natal life are closely similar to stages in the
6938: development of the anthropoid embryo. Babies born in times of famine or
6941: institution for the care of children who show arrested, defective, or
6942: disturbed development leaves one sadly impressed with the risk of
6943: slipping down the rungs of the steep ladder of evolution; and even in
6944: adults the occurrence of serious nervous disturbance, such as
6946: familiar fact that a normal baby reveals the past in its surprising
6947: power of grip, and the careful experiments of Dr. Louis Robinson showed
6950: distress is evinced and no cry uttered, until the grasp begins to give
6951: way." This persistent grasp probably points back to the time when the
6952: baby had to cling to its arboreal mother. The human tail is represented
6953: in the adult by a fusion of four or five vertebræ forming the "coccyx"
6954: at the end of the backbone, and is normally concealed beneath the
6955: flesh, but in the embryo the tail projects freely and is movable. Up to
6956: the sixth month of the ante-natal sleep the body is covered, all but the
6957: palms and soles, with longish hair (the lanugo), which usually
6958: disappears before birth. This is a stage in the normal development,
6959: which is reasonably interpreted as a recapitulation of a stage in the
6960: racial evolution. We draw this inference when we find that the unborn

6964: It must be noticed that there are two serious errors in the careless
6968: first error here is that the comparison should be made with
6970: the making of the embryos that the great resemblance lies. When the
6971: human embryo shows the laying down of the essential vertebrate
6972: characters, such as brain and spinal cord, then it is closely comparable
6973: to the embryo of a lower vertebrate at a similar stage. When, at a
6975: four-chambered mammalian heart, it is closely comparable to the heart
6977: The point is that in the making of the organs of the body, say brain and
6978: kidneys, the embryo of man pursues a path closely corresponding to the
6979: path followed by the embryos of other backboned animals lower in the
6980: scale, but at successive stages it parts company with these, with the
6982: little reptile, but the developing organs pass through stages which very
6983: closely resemble the corresponding stages in lower types which are in a
6987: the first a certain individuality, with peculiar characteristics which
6988: are all its own. This is expressed by the somewhat difficult word
6990: other. So in the development of the human embryo, while there are close

7025: pedigree. Darwin called the pinhead brain of the ant the most marvellous
7026: atom of matter in the world, but the human ovum is more marvellous

7034: thousand years ago, in the developing egg of the hen there soon appears
7035: the beating heart! There is nothing like this in the non-living world.
7036: But to return to the developing human embryo, there is formed from and
7037: above the embryonic food-canal a skeletal rod, which is called the
7038: notochord. It thrills the imagination to learn that this is the only
7039: supporting axis that the lower orders of the backboned race possess. The
7040: curious thing is that it does not become the backbone, which is
7041: certainly one of the essential features of the vertebrate race. The
7042: notochord is the supporting axis of the pioneer backboned animals,
7043: namely the Lancelets and the Round-mouths (Cyclostomes), such as the
7044: Lamprey. They have no backbone in the strict sense, but they have this
7045: notochord. It can easily be dissected out in the lamprey--a long gristly
7046: rod. It is surrounded by a sheath which becomes the backbone of most
7048: the notochord is only a vestige in the adults of these types, it is
7049: never absent from the embryo. It occurs even in man, a short-lived relic
7050: of the primeval supporting axis of the body. It comes and then it goes,
7051: leaving only minute traces in the adult. We cannot say that it is of any
7052: use, unless it serves as a stimulus to the development of its
7053: substitute, the backbone. It is only a piece of preliminary scaffolding,
7054: but there is no more eloquent instance of the living hand of the past.
7056: One other instance must suffice of what Professor Lull calls the
7057: wonderful changes wrought in the dark of the ante-natal period, which
7058: recapitulate in rapid abbreviation the great evolutionary steps which
7059: were taken by man's ancestors "during the long night of the geological
7060: past." On the sides of the neck of the human embryo there are four pairs
7061: of slits, the "visceral clefts," openings from the beginning of the
7062: food-canals to the surface. There is no doubt as to their significance.
7063: They correspond to the gill-slits of fishes and tadpoles. Yet in
7064: reptiles, birds, and mammals they have no connection with breathing,
7065: which is their function in fishes and amphibians. Indeed, they are not
7066: of any use at all, except that the first becomes the Eustachian tube
7067: bringing the ear-passage into connection with the back of the mouth, and
7068: that the second and third have to do with the development of a curious
7069: organ called the thymus gland. Persistent, nevertheless, these
7073: When all these lines of evidence are considered, they are seen to

7087: from a stock common to him and to the higher apes. Those who are
7088: repelled by the idea of man's derivation from a simian type should
7089: remember that the theory implies rather more than this, namely, that man

7107:     is very profitable to recognise the two facts.
7115: illustrations, all point to man's affiliation with the order of monkeys
7116: and apes. To this order is given the name Primates, and our first and
7117: second question must be when and whence the Primates began. The rock
7118: record answers the first question: the Primates emerged about the dawn
7119: of the Eocene era, when grass was beginning to cover the earth with a
7120: garment. Their ancestral home was in the north in both hemispheres, and
7121: then they migrated to Africa, India, Malay, and South America. In North
7122: America the Primates soon became extinct, and the same thing happened
7123: later on in Europe. In this case, however, there was a repeopling from
7124: the South (in the Lower Miocene) and then a second extinction (in the
7126: support of Professor R. S. Lull's conclusion, that in Southern Asia,
7127: Africa, and South America the evolution of Primates was continuous since
7128: the first great southward migration, and there is, of course, an
7129: abundant modern representation of Primates in these regions to-day.
7131: As to the second question: Whence the Primates sprang, the answer must
7133: Primates sprang from a common Insectivore stock, the one order diverging
7134: towards flesh-eating and hunting on the ground, the other order
7136: that the Insectivores (including shrews, tree-shrews, hedgehog, mole,
7137: and the like) were very plastic and progressive mammals.
7139: What followed in the course of ages was the divergence of branch after
7140: branch from the main Primate stem. First there diverged the South
7141: American monkeys on a line of their own, and then the Old World monkeys,
7142: such as the macaques and baboons. Ages passed and the main stems gave
7143: off (in the Oligocene period) the branch now represented by the small
7144: anthropoid apes--the gibbon and the siamang. Distinctly later there
7145: diverged the branch of the large anthropoid apes--the gorilla, the
7146: chimpanzee, and the orang. That left a generalised humanoid stock
7147: separated off from all monkeys and apes, and including the immediate
7149: took place remains very uncertain, some authorities referring it to the
7150: Miocene, others to the early Pliocene. Some would estimate its date at
7151: half a million years ago, others at two millions! The fact is that
7156: Notice in the gorilla's skull the protrusive face region, the big
7157: eyebrow ridges, the much less domed cranial cavity, the massive lower
7158: jaw, the big canine teeth. Notice in man's skull the well-developed
7159: forehead, the domed and spacious cranial cavity, the absence of any
7160: snout, the chin process, and many other marked differences separating

7174: We are on firmer, though still uncertain, ground when we state the
7175: probability that it was in Asia that the precursors of man were
7176: separated off from monkeys and apes, and began to be terrestrial rather
7177: than arboreal. Professor Lull points out that Asia is nearest to the
7178: oldest known human remains (in Java), and that Asia was the seat of the
7179: most ancient civilisations and the original home of many domesticated
7180: animals and cultivated plants. The probability is that the cradle of the
7188: Wood Jones has worked out very convincingly the thesis that man had no
7189: direct four-footed ancestry, but that the Primate stock to which he
7190: belongs was from its first divergence arboreal. He maintains that the
7191: leading peculiarities of the immediate precursors of man were wrought
7193: arboreal life on bipedal erect lines (not after the quadrupedal fashion
7194: of tree-sloths, for instance) was the emancipation of the hand. The
7195: foot became the supporting and branch-gripping member, and the hand was
7196: set free to reach upward, to hang on by, to seize the fruit, to lift it
7197: and hold it to the mouth, and to hug the young one close to the breast.
7201: The arboreal life had many other consequences. It led to an increased
7202: freedom of movement of the thigh on the hip joint, to muscular
7203: arrangements for balancing the body on the leg, to making the backbone a
7205: which is only found well-formed when the fore-limb is used for more than
7206: support, and to a power of "opposing" the thumb and the big toe to the
7207: other digits of the hand and foot--an obvious advantage for
7208: branch-gripping. But the evolution of a free hand made it possible to
7209: dispense with protrusive lips and gripping teeth. Thus began the
7210: recession of the snout region, the associated enlargement of the
7211: brain-box, and the bringing of the eyes to the front. The overcrowding
7212: of the teeth that followed the shortening of the snout was one of the
7216: Another acquisition associated with arboreal life was a greatly
7217: increased power of turning the head from side to side--a mobility very
7218: important in locating sounds and in exploring with the eyes.
7219: Furthermore, there came about a flattening of the chest and of the back,
7220: and the movements of the midriff (or diaphragm) came to count for more
7221: in respiration than the movements of the ribs. The sense of touch came
7222: to be of more importance and the sense of smell of less; the part of the
7224: over the part for receiving olfactory messages. Finally, the need for
7225: carrying the infant about among the branches must surely have implied an
7226: intensification of family relations, and favoured the evolution of
7243: Bone for bone, the two skeletons are like one another, though man is a
7244: biped and the horse a quadruped. The backbone in man is mainly vertical;
7245: the backbone in the horse is horizontal except in the neck and the tail.
7246: Man's skull is mainly in a line with the backbone; the horse's at an
7248: digits on each limb; the horse has only one digit well developed on each
7251: It may be urged that we are attaching too much importance to the
7253: very innocent creatures. To this reasonable objection there are two
7254: answers, first that in its many acquisitions the arboreal evolution of
7255: the _humanoid_ precursors of man prepared the way for the survival of a
7257: that the passage from the humanoid to the human was probably associated
7258: with _a return to mother earth_.
7261: (1917), we are much indebted, "climatic conditions in Asia in the
7262: Miocene or early Pliocene were such as to compel the descent of the
7263: pre-human ancestor from the trees, a step which was absolutely essential
7264: to further human development." Continental elevation and consequent
7265: aridity led to a dwindling of the forests, and forced the ape-man to
7266: come to earth. "And at the last arose the man."
7268: According to Lull, the descent from the trees was associated with the
7270: plasticity of the hand, with becoming a hunter, with experiments towards
7271: clothing and shelter, with an exploring habit, and with the beginning of
7274: It is a plausible view that the transition from the humanoid to the
7277: to do with the brain and the vocal organs. But given the gains of the
7278: arboreal apprenticeship, the stimulus of an enforced descent to terra
7280: factors which helped success to succeed. Perhaps the absence of great
7281: physical strength prompted reliance on wits; the prolongation of infancy
7282: would help to educate the parents in gentleness; the strengthening of
7283: the feeling of kinship would favour the evolution of family and social
7284: life--of which there are many anticipations at lower levels. There is
7285: much truth in the saying: "Man did not make society, society made man."
7287: A continuation of the story will deal with the emergence of the
7288: primitive types of man and the gradual ascent of the modern species.
7295: So far the story has been that of the sifting out of a humanoid stock
7296: and of the transition to human kind, from the ancestors of apes and men
7297: to the man-ape, and from the man-ape to man. It looks as if the
7298: sifting-out process had proceeded further, for there were several human
7299: branches that did not lead on to the modern type of man.
7301: 1. The first of these is represented by the scanty fossil remains known
7302: as _Pithecanthropus erectus_, found in Java in fossiliferous beds which
7303: date from the end of the Pliocene or the beginning of the Pleistocene
7304: era. Perhaps this means half a million years ago, and the remains
7306: Unfortunately the remains of Pithecanthropus the Erect consisted only of
7308: that experts should differ considerably in their interpretation of what
7309: was found. Some have regarded the remains as those of a large gibbon,
7310: others as those of a pre-human ape-man, and others as those of a
7311: primitive man off the main line of ascent. According to Sir Arthur
7312: Keith, Pithecanthropus was "a being human in stature, human in gait,
7314: height of about 5 feet 7 inches, one inch less than the average height
7315: of the men of to-day. The skull-cap indicates a low, flat forehead,
7316: beetling brows, and a capacity about two-thirds of the modern size. The

7321: Schoetensack. But the remains consisted only of a lower jaw and its
7325: ago. There were also very crude flint implements (or eoliths). But the
7326: teeth are human teeth, and the jaw seems transitional between that of an
7327: anthropoid ape and that of man. Thus there was no chin. According to
7328: most authorities the lower jaw from the Heidelberg sand-pit must be
7329: regarded as a relic of a primitive type off the main line of human
7334: (_Pithecanthropus erectus._)]
7336: 3. It was in all probability in the Pliocene that there took origin the
7338: remains found in 1856 in the Neanderthal ravine near Düsseldorf.
7340: quarter of a million years ago. Other specimens were afterwards found
7341: elsewhere, e.g. in Belgium ("the men of Spy"), in France, in Croatia,
7346: furnished them with an outfit for a long journey; and he had a big
7348: jaws, and he showed "simian characters swarming in the details of his
7349: structure." In most of the points in which he differs from modern man he
7350: approaches the anthropoid apes, and he must be regarded as a low type of
7351: man off the main line. Huxley regarded the Neanderthal man as a low form
7352: of the modern type, but expert opinion seems to agree rather with the
7353: view maintained in 1864 by Professor William King of Galway, that the
7354: Neanderthal man represents a distinct species off the main line of
7356: races to-day) about the end of the Fourth Great Ice Age; but there is
7357: evidence that before he ceased to be there had emerged a successor
7358: rather than a descendant--the modern man.
7360: 4. Another offshoot from the main line is probably represented by the
7361: Piltdown man, found in Sussex in 1912. The remains consisted of the
7362: walls of the skull, which indicate a large brain, and a high forehead
7363: without the beetling eyebrows of the Neanderthal man and
7364: Pithecanthropus. The "find" included a tooth and part of a lower jaw,
7365: but these perhaps belong to some ape, for they are very discrepant. The
7366: Piltdown skull represents the most ancient human remains as yet found in
7368: Eoanthropus expresses his conviction that the Piltdown man was off the
7369: line of the evolution of the modern type. If the tooth and piece of
7370: lower jaw belong to the Piltdown skull, then there was a remarkable
7371: combination of ape-like and human characters. As regards the brain,
7372: _inferred_ from the skull-walls, Sir Arthur Keith says:
7374:     All the essential features of the brain of modern man are to be seen
7375:     in the brain cast. There are some which must be regarded as
7376:     primitive. There can be no doubt that it is built on exactly the
7378:     it in all respects a modern brain.... Although our knowledge of the
7379:     human brain is limited--there are large areas to which we can assign
7382:     the outside world as ours does. Piltdown man saw, heard, felt,
7388: There is neither agreement nor certainty as to the antiquity of man,
7389: except that the modern type was distinguishable from its collaterals
7391: grand. In remote antiquity the Primate stem diverged from the other
7392: orders of mammals; it sent forth its tentative branches, and the result
7393: was a tangle of monkeys; ages passed and the monkeys were left behind,
7394: while the main stem, still probing its way, gave off the Anthropoid
7395: apes, both small and large. But they too were left behind, and the main
7396: line gave off other experiments--indications of which we know in Java,
7397: at Heidelberg, in the Neanderthal, and at Piltdown. None of these lasted
7398: or was made perfect. They represent _tentative_ men who had their day
7399: and ceased to be, our predecessors rather than our ancestors. Still, the

7444: in Périgord, Mentone on the Riviera; and they are often referred to as
7445: "Cave-men" or "men of the Early Stone Age." They had large skulls, high
7446: foreheads, well-marked chins, and other features such as modern man

7452: implements--knives, scrapers, gravers, and the like, of the type known
7453: as Palæolithic, and these show interesting gradations of skill and
7454: peculiarities of style. The "Cave-men" lived between the third and
7456: woolly rhinoceros, Irish elk, and other mammals now extinct--taking us
7458: the big-brained skulls of these Palæolithic cave-men show not a single

7462: that these vigorous Palæolithic Cave-men of Europe were living for a

7464: that they directly or indirectly hastened the disappearance of their
7465: more primitive collaterals. Curiously enough, however, they had not
7466: themselves adequate lasting power in Europe, for they seem for the most
7468: in isolated districts. The probability is that after their decline
7470: there is any inherent biological necessity for the decline of a vigorous

7479: After the Ice Ages had passed, perhaps 25,000 years ago, the Palæolithic
7480: culture gave place to the Neolithic. The men who made rudely dressed but
7483: were of this Neolithic culture, migrating from the Continent when the
7484: ice-fields of the Great Glaciation had disappeared. Their remains are
7485: often associated with the "Fifty-foot Beach" which, though now high and
7486: dry, was the seashore in early Neolithic days. Much is known about these
7487: men of the polished stones. They were hunters, fowlers, and fishermen;
7489: inches below the present standard; living an active strenuous life.
7490: Similarly, for the south, Sir Arthur Keith pictures for us a Neolithic

7513: We must open one more chapter in the thrilling story of the Ascent of
7514: Man--the Metal Ages, which are in a sense still continuing. Metals began
7515: to be used in the late Polished Stone (Neolithic) times, for there were
7517: The working of copper in the East has been traced back to the fourth
7518: millennium B.C., and there was also a very ancient Copper Age in the New
7522: The ores of different metals seem to have been smelted together in an
7523: experimental way by many prehistoric metallurgists, and bronze was the
7524: alloy that rewarded the combination of tin with copper. There is
7528: It is not clear why iron should not have been the earliest metal to be
7529: used by man, but the Iron Age dates from about the middle of the second
7530: millennium B.C. From Egypt the usage spread through the Mediterranean
7533: for instance, the route of the amber trade from the Baltic. Compared
7534: with stone, the metals afforded much greater possibilities of
7535: implements, instruments, and weapons, and their discovery and usage had
7536: undoubtedly great influence on the Ascent of Man. Occasionally, however,
7542: Looking backwards, we discern the following stages: (1) The setting
7543: apart of a Primate stock, marked off from other mammals by a tendency to
7546: Old World monkeys, leaving a stock--an anthropoid stock--common to the
7548: the Anthropoid apes diverged, far from ignoble creatures, and a humanoid
7549: stock was set apart. (4) From the latter (we follow Sir Arthur Keith and
7550: other authorities) there arose what may be called, without
7552: Pithecanthropus "the Erect," the Heidelberg man, the Neanderthalers,
7553: and, best of all, the early men of the Sussex Weald--hinted at by the
7554: Piltdown skull. It matters little whether particular items are
7555: corroborated or disproved--e.g. whether the Heidelberg man came before
7556: or after the Neanderthalers--the general trend of evolution remains
7557: clear. (5) In any case, the result was the evolution of _Homo sapiens,
7558: the man we are_--a quite different fellow from the Neanderthaler. (6)
7560: holding fast to that which is good. There were the Palæolithic peoples,
7563: shoots from the growing point of the old race, or as a fresh offshoot
7564: from more generalised members at a lower level. This is the eternal
7566: were involved in the succession of four Great Ice Ages or
7567: Glaciations, and it may be that the human race owes much to the
7569: the ice-fields cleared off Neolithic man had his innings. (8) And we
7570: have closed the story, in the meantime, with the Metal Ages.

7581: The men of this race lived in Europe from the Third Interglacial period
7582: through the Fourth Glacial. They disappeared somewhat suddenly, being
7583: replaced by the Modern Man type, such as the Cromagnards. Many regard
7584: the Neanderthal Men as a distinct species.]
7586: It seems not unfitting that we should at this point sound another
7587: note--that of the man of feeling. It is clear in William James's words:
7589:     Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, are these half-brutish
7590:     prehistoric brothers. Girdled about with the immense darkness of
7591:     this mysterious universe even as we are, they were born and died,
7593:     plunged in the blackest ignorance, preyed upon by hideous and
7594:     grotesque delusions, yet steadfastly serving the profoundest of
7595:     ideals in their fixed faith that existence in any form is better
7596:     than non-existence, they ever rescued triumphantly from the jaws of
7597:     ever imminent destruction the torch of life which, thanks to them,
7598:     now lights the world for us.
7606: "Punics," and so forth; and thus there arose races of men. Certain types
7607: suited certain areas, and periods of in-breeding tended to make the
7609: stable. When the original peculiarities, say, of negro and Mongol,
7611: then they would have great staying power from generation to generation.
7614: other change-producing factors, would provoke new departures from age to
7615: age, and so fresh racial ventures were made. Moreover, the occurrence
7617: serve to induce fresh starts. Very important in the evolution of human
7618: races must have been the alternating occurrence of periods of
7623: races of mankind--notably the African, the Australian, the Mongolian,
7624: and the Caucasian. The woolly-haired African race includes the negroes
7625: and the very primitive bushmen. The wavy-to curly-haired Australian race
7626: includes the Jungle Tribes of the Deccan, the Vedda of Ceylon, the
7627: Jungle Folk or Semang, and the natives of unsettled parts of
7628: Australia--all sometimes slumped together as "Pre-Dravidians." The
7630: Formosa, those of many oceanic islands, and of the north from Japan to
7634: There are very few corners of knowledge more difficult than that of the
7635: Races of Men, the chief reason being that there has been so much
7636: movement and migration in the course of the ages. One physical type has
7637: mingled with another, inducing strange amalgams and novelties. If we

7644: of human beings whose type has been unified by their rate of
7645: assimilation exceeding the rate of change produced by the infiltration
7646: of foreign elements. It is probable, however, that the progress of
7647: precise anthropology will make it possible to distinguish the various
7648: racial "strains" that make up any people. For the human sense of race

7680: reasoned discourse. In some other lines of mammalian evolution there

7685: vocal powers. How these great cerebral advances came about we do not
7686: know, but it has been one of the main trends of animal evolution to
7687: improve the nervous system. Two suggestions may be made. First, the
7688: prolongation of the period of ante-natal life, in intimate physiological
7689: partnership with the mother, may have made it practicable to start the
7690: higher mammal with a much better brain than in the lower orders, like
7691: Insectivores and Rodents, and still more Marsupials, where the period
7692: before birth (gestation) is short. Second, we know that the individual
7693: development of the brain is profoundly influenced by the internal
7694: secretions of certain ductless glands notably the thyroid. When this
7695: organ is not functioning properly the child's brain development is
7700: Given variability along the line of better brains and given a process of

7707: of man's advance is dependent on the external registration of the social
7708: heritage, not on the slowly changing natural inheritance.
7711: progress. There is a ring of truth in the fine description Æschylus gave
7714:     first, beholding they beheld in vain, and, hearing, heard not, but,
7715:     like shapes in dreams, mixed all things wildly down the tedious
7716:     time, nor knew to build a house against the sun with wicketed sides,
7717:     nor any woodwork knew, but lived like silly ants, beneath the
7718:     ground, in hollow caves unsunned. There came to them no steadfast
7720:     fruit, but blindly and lawlessly they did all things.
7722: Contrast this picture with the position of man to-day. He has mastered
7723: the forces of Nature and is learning to use their resources more and
7725: has made the ether carry his messages. He tapped supplies of material

7734: line of movement is towards the fuller embodiment of the true, the
7735: beautiful, and the good in healthy lives which are increasingly a
7736: satisfaction in themselves.
7743: Very striking are the prominent eyebrow ridges and the broad massive
7745: cranial capacity is far above the lowest human limit. The teeth are
7746: interesting in showing marked rotting or "caries," hitherto unknown in

7788: Many, we believe, were the gains that rewarded the arboreal
7789: apprenticeship of man's ancestors. Many, likewise, were the results of
7790: leaving the trees and coming down to the solid earth--a transition which
7791: marked the emergence of more than tentative men. What great steps
7794: Some of the greatest were--the working out of a spoken language and of
7795: external methods of registration; the invention of tools; the discovery
7796: of the use of fire; the utilisation of iron and other metals; the taming
7797: of wild animals such as dog and sheep, horses and cattle; the
7798: cultivation of wild plants such as wheat and rice; and the irrigation of
7799: fields. All through the ages necessity has been the mother of invention
7800: and curiosity its father; but perhaps we miss the heart of the matter if
7801: we forget the importance of some leisure time--wherein to observe and
7802: think. If our earth had been so clouded that the stars were hidden from
7803: men's eyes the whole history of our race would have been different. For
7804: it was through his leisure-time observations of the stars that early man
7805: discovered the regularity of the year and got his fundamental
7806: impressions of the order of Nature--on which all his science is founded.
7808: If we are to think clearly of the factors of human progress we must
7809: recall the three great biological ideas--the living organism, its
7810: environment, and its functioning. For man these mean (1) the living
7811: creature, the outcome of parents and ancestors, a fresh expression of a
7812: bodily and mental inheritance; (2) the surroundings, including climate
7813: and soil, the plants and animals these allow; and (3) the activities of
7814: all sorts, occupations and habits, all the actions and reactions between
7816: the _Famille_, _Lieu_, _Travail_ of the LePlay school.
7820: mind, and an indispensable sociality. The most powerful factors in the
7821: world are clear ideas in the minds of energetic men of good will. The
7823: within a people, just as they mark individuals, are themselves traceable
7824: back to germinal variations or mutations, and to the kind of sifting to
7825: which the race or stock has been subjected. Easygoing conditions are not
7826: only without stimulus to new departures, they are without the sifting
7829: As to PLACE, it is plain that different areas differ greatly in their
7830: material resources and in the availability of these. Moreover, even when
7831: abundant material resources are present, they will not make for much
7832: progress unless the climate is such that they can be readily utilised.
7833: Indeed, climate has been one of the great factors in civilisation, here
7834: stimulating and there depressing energy, in one place favouring certain
7835: plants and animals important to man, in another place preventing their
7838: As to WORK, the form of a civilisation is in some measure dependent on
7839: the primary occupations, whether hunting or fishing, farming or
7840: shepherding; and on the industries of later ages which have a profound
7841: moulding effect on the individual at least. We cannot, however, say more
7842: than that the factors of human progress have always had these three

7877: Evolution, as we have seen in a previous chapter, is another word for
7878: race-history. It means the ceaseless process of Becoming, linking
7880: states the fact that the present is the child of the past and the parent
7881: of the future. It comes to this, that the living plants and animals we
7882: know are descended from ancestors on the whole simpler, and these from
7883: others likewise simpler, and so on, back and back--till we reach the
7886: new forms arise, take root, and flourish, alongside of or in the place
7887: of their ancestors, which were in most cases rather simpler in structure

7892: when the only backboned animals were Fishes. Ages passed, and there
7894: Ages passed, and there evolved Reptiles, in bewildering profusion. There
7896: dragons, a prolific and varied stock. From the terrestrial Dinosaurs it
7897: seems that Birds and Mammals arose. In succeeding ages there evolved all
7898: the variety of Birds and all the variety of Mammals. Until at last arose
7899: the Man. The question is whether similar processes of evolution are
7902: We are so keenly aware of rapid changes in mankind, though these
7903: concern the social heritage much more than the flesh-and-blood natural
7904: inheritance, that we find no difficulty in the idea that evolution is
7905: going on in mankind. We know the contrast between modern man and
7906: primitive man, and we are convinced that in the past, at least, progress
7908: possibility--involution rather than evolution--but even if going back
7909: became for a time the rule, we cannot give up the hope that the race
7910: would recover itself and begin afresh to go forward. For although there
7911: have been retrogressions in the history of life, continued through
7912: unthinkably long ages, and although great races, the Flying Dragons for
7914: we feel sure that there has been on the whole a progress towards nobler,
7919: the whole _progressive evolution_.
7924: It is not likely that man's body will admit of _great_ change, but there
7925: is room for some improvement, e.g. in the superfluous length of the
7926: food-canal and the overcrowding of the teeth. It is likely, however,
7927: that there will be constitutional changes, e.g. of prolonged
7930: improvements in intelligence and in control. The potentialities of the
7931: human brain, as it is, are far from being utilised to the full, and new
7933: importance is that the new departures or variations which emerge in fine

8182: imported from India into Canada about thirty years ago. The father was
8183: part of a cargo that came from the Baltic to Glasgow, and was happily
8187: the cross was a medley of types, nearly a hundred varieties altogether,
8188: and it was in scrutinising these that Dr. Saunders hit upon Marquis. He
8189: worked steadily through the material, studying head after head of what
8191: Each of the heads selected was propagated; most of the results were
8192: rejected; the elect were sifted again and yet again, and finally Marquis
8193: Wheat emerged, rich in constructive possibilities, probably the most

8223: considerable changes of climate, for climate calls the tune to which
8224: living creatures dance, but it is also due to new departures among the

8313: falling, and it is not in size only that there is loss, there is a

8358: over again in different groups of animals there have been attempts to
8359: master different kinds of haunts--such as the underground world, the
8360: trees, the freshwaters, and the air. There are burrowing amphibians,
8361: burrowing reptiles, burrowing birds, and burrowing mammals; there are
8366: with far-reaching consequences. What the freeing of the hand from being
8367: an organ of terrestrial support has meant in the evolution of monkeys is
8371: The Case of the Robber Crab
8373: On some of the coral islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans there
8374: lives a land-crab, Birgus, which has learned to breathe on land. It
8375: breathes dry air by means of curious blood-containing tufts in the upper
8377: about a foot long, and it has very heavy great claws, especially on the
8378: left-hand side. With this great claw it hammers on the "eye-hole" of a
8379: coconut, from which it has torn off the fibrous husk. It hammers until a
8380: hole is made by which it can get at the pulp. Part of the shell is
8381: sometimes used as a protection for the soft abdomen--for the
8382: robber-crab, as it is called, is an offshoot from the hermit-crab stock.
8383: Every year this quaint explorer, which may go far up the hills and climb
8384: the coco-palms, has to go back to the sea to spawn. The young ones are
8385: hatched in the same state as in our common shore-crab. That is to say,
8386: they are free-swimming larvæ which pass through an open-water period
8387: before they settle down on the shore, and eventually creep up on to dry
8388: land. Just as open-water turtles lay their eggs on sandy shores, going
8389: back to their old terrestrial haunt, so the robber-crab, which has
8390: almost conquered the dry land, has to return to the seashore to breed.
8391: There is a peculiar interest in the association of the robber-crab with
8392: the coco-palm, for that tree is not a native of these coral islands, but
8393: has been introduced, perhaps from Mexico, by the Polynesian mariners
8394: before the discovery of America by Columbus. So the learning to deal

8402: 2. The embryo within the egg, just before hatching. The embryo has been
8403: constricted off from the yolk-laden portion of the egg.
8408: 4 and 5. The larval salmon, still being nourished from the yolk-sac
8409: (Y.S.), which is diminishing in size as the fish grows larger.
8411: 6. The salmon fry about six weeks old, with the yolk fully absorbed, so
8412: that the young fish has now to feed for itself. The fry become parr,
8413: which go to the sea as smolts, and return as grilse.
8415: In all cases the small figures to the right indicate the natural size.]
8420: Again and again we see them jumping out of the seething foam beneath the
8421: fall, casting themselves into the curtain of the down-rushing water,
8422: only to be carried back by it into the depths whence they have risen.
8423: One here and another there makes its effort good, touches the upper lip
8424: of the cataract, gives a swift stroke of its tail, and rushes on towards
8425: those upper reaches which are the immemorial spawning beds of its
8429: The Story of the Salmon
8431: In late autumn or in winter the salmon spawn in the rivers. The female
8432: makes a shallow trough in the gravel by moving her tail from side to
8433: side, and therein lays many eggs. The male, who is in attendance,
8434: fertilises these with the milt, and then the female covers them deeply
8436: more till all the eggs are shed. For three to four months the eggs
8437: develop, and eventually there emerge the larvæ or _alevins_, which lurk
8438: among the pebbles. They cannot swim much, for they are encumbered by a
8439: big legacy of yolk. In a few weeks, perhaps eight, the protruding bag of
8440: yolk has disappeared and the _fry_, about an inch long, begin to move
8441: about more actively and to fend for themselves. By the end of the year
8442: they have grown to be rather trout-like _parr_, about four inches long.
8443: In two years these are double that length. Usually in the second year,
8444: but it may be earlier or later, the parr become silvery _smolts_, which
8445: go out to sea, usually about the month of May. They feed on young
8446: herring and the like and grow large and strong. When they are about
8447: three and a half years old they come up the rivers as _grilse_ and may
8448: spawn. Or they may pass through the whole grilse stage in the sea and
8449: come up the rivers with all the characters of the full-grown fish. In
8450: many cases the salmon spawn only once, and some (they are called _kelts_
8452: they die or fall a victim to otters and other enemies. In the case of
8453: the salmon of the North Pacific (in the genus _Oncorhynchus_, not
8454: _Salmo_) all the individuals die after spawning, none being able to
8455: return to the sea. It must be remembered that full-grown salmon do not
8456: as a rule feed in fresh water, though they may be unable to resist
8457: snapping at the angler's strange creations. A very interesting fact is
8458: that the salmon keeps as it were a diary of its movements, which vary a
8459: good deal in different rivers. This diary is written in the scales, and
8460: a careful reading of the concentric lines on the scales shows the age of
8461: the fish, and when it went out to sea, and whether it has spawned or
8465: Interpretation of the Salmon's Story
8468: breeds, it is very often safe to say that the breeding-place represents
8469: the original home. The flounder is quite comfortable far up the rivers,
8470: but it has to go to the shore-waters to spawn, and there is no doubt
8471: that the flounder is a marine fish which has recently learned to
8472: colonise the fresh waters. Its relatives, like plaice and sole, are
8473: strictly marine. But it is impossible to make a dogma of the rule that
8474: the breeding-place corresponds to the original home. Thus some kinds of
8475: bass, which belong to the marine family of sea-perches, live in the sea
8477: water. Or, again, the members of the herring family are very
8478: distinctively marine, but the shad, which belong to this family, spawn
8479: in rivers and may spend their lives there.
8481: So there are two different ways of interpreting the life-history of the
8482: salmon. Some authorities regard the salmon as a marine fish which is
8483: establishing itself in fresh water. But others read the story the other
8484: way and regard the salmon as a member of a freshwater race, that has
8485: taken to the sea for feeding purposes. In regard to trout, we know that
8486: the ranks of those in rivers and lakes are continually being reinforced
8487: by migrants from the sea, and that some trout go down to the sea while
8488: others remain in the freshwater. We know also in regard to a related
8489: fish, the char, that while the great majority of kinds are now permanent
8490: residents in cold and deep, isolated northern lakes, there are Arctic
8491: forms which live in the sea but enter the rivers to spawn. These facts
8492: favour the view that the salmon was originally a marine fish. But there
8493: are arguments on both sides, and, for our present purpose, the important
8494: fact is that the salmon is conquering _two_ haunts. Its evolution is
8498: The Romance of the Eel
8500: Early in summer, at dates varying with the distance of the rivers from
8501: the open Atlantic, crowds of young eels or elvers come up-stream.
8502: Sometimes the procession or eel-fare includes thousands of individuals,
8503: each about the length of our first finger, and as thick as a stout
8504: knitting needle. They obey an inborn impulse to swim against the stream,
8505: seeking automatically to have both sides of their body equally
8506: stimulated by the current. So they go straight ahead. The obligation
8507: works only during the day, for when the sun goes down behind the hills
8508: the elvers snuggle under stones or beneath the bank and rest till dawn.
8509: In the course of time they reach the quiet upper reaches of the river or
8510: go up rivulets and drainpipes to the isolated ponds. Their impulse to go
8511: on must be very imperious, for they may wriggle up the wet moss by the

8516: Eventually, after five or six years in the case of the males, six to
8517: eight years in the case of the females, the well-grown fishes, perhaps a
8520: large of eye, and they return to the sea. In getting away from the pond
8521: it may be necessary to wriggle through the damp meadow-grass before
8522: reaching the river. They travel by night and rather excitedly. The
8523: Arctic Ocean is too cold for them and the North Sea too shallow. They
8524: must go far out to sea, to where the old margin of the once larger
8525: continent of Europe slopes down to the great abysses, from the Hebrides
8526: southwards. Eels seem to spawn in the deep dark water; but the just

8532: them before their real nature was proved. They gradually become shorter,
8533: and the shape changes from knife-blade-like to cylindrical. During this
8534: change they fast, and the weight of their delicate body decreases. They

8537: they may be a year and a half old before they reach their destination
8538: and go up-stream as elvers. Those that ascend the rivers of the Eastern

8542: in from the Atlantic, some of them perhaps from the Azores or further
8543: out still. It is interesting to inquire how the young eels circumvent
8544: the Falls of the Rhine and get into Lake Constance, or how their kindred
8545: on the other side of the Atlantic overcome the obstacle of Niagara; but
8546: it is more important to lay emphasis on the variety of habitats which
8547: this fish is trying--the deep waters, the open sea, the shore, the
8548: river, the pond, and even, it may be, a little taste of solid earth. It
8549: seems highly probable that the common eel is a deep-water marine fish
8550: which has learned to colonise the freshwaters. It has been adventurous
8551: and it has succeeded. The only shadow on the story of achievement is
8552: that there seems to be no return from the spawning. There is little
8553: doubt that death is the nemesis of their reproduction. In any case, no
8554: adult eel ever comes back from the deep sea. We are minded of Goethe's
8563: has turned its swim-bladder into a lung and comes to the surface to
8565: gulps. At the same time, like an ordinary fish, it has gills which allow
8566: the usual interchange of gases between the blood and the water. Now this

8570: back as the Jurassic, which probably means over five millions of years
8571: ago. The Queensland mudfish is an antiquity, and there has not been much
8573: illustration of the inertia of evolution. And yet, though its structure
8574: has changed but little, the fish probably illustrates evolution in
8575: process, for it is a fish that is learning to breathe dry air. It cannot
8576: leave the water; but it can live comfortably in pools which are foul

8580: _possible_, that the swim-bladder of fishes was originally a lung, the
8581: mud-fishes are learning to breathe dry air. They illustrate evolution

8604: its feathers are loose and hair-like, whilst its wings are merely
8614: parts of Britain, it has been becoming in the summer months more and
8615: more of a vegetarian, scooping out the turnips, devouring potatoes,
8616: settling on the sheaves in the harvest field and gorging itself with
8618: birds; but the most signal illustration is that of the kea or Nestor
8619: parrot of New Zealand, which has taken to lighting on the loins of the
8620: sheep, tearing away the fleece, cutting at the skin, and gouging out
8621: fat. Now the parrot belongs to a vegetarian or frugivorous stock, and
8622: this change of diet in the relatively short time since sheep-ranches
8624: the dates, we may speak of evolution going on under our eyes. It must be
8627: from within, as expressions of germinal changefulness rather than as
8628: imprints from without. For of the transmissibility of the latter there
8634: It is very interesting to think of the numerous types of locomotion
8636: and of the changes that are rung on these four main methods. How
8637: striking is the case of the frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus) of
8638: Australia, which at the present time is, as it were, experimenting in
8639: bipedal progression--always a rather eventful thing to do. It gets up on
8643: How beautiful is the adventure which has led our dipper or
8644: water-ouzel--a bird allied to the wrens--to try walking and flying under
8645: water! How admirable is the volplaning of numerous parachutists--"flying
8647: squirrel," and more besides, which take great leaps through the air. For
8648: are these not the splendid failures that might have succeeded in
8651: Most daring of all, perhaps, are the aerial journeys undertaken by many
8652: small spiders. On a breezy morning, especially in the autumn, they mount
8653: on gate-posts and palings and herbage, and, standing with their head to
8654: the wind, pay out three or four long threads of silk. When the wind tugs
8655: at these threads, the spinners let go, and are borne, usually back
8656: downwards, on the wings of the wind from one parish to another. It is
8657: said that if the wind falls they can unfurl more sail, or furl if it
8658: rises. In any case, these wingless creatures make aerial journeys. When
8659: tens of thousands of the used threads sink to earth, there is a "shower

8704: dispute the statement that spiders are thoroughly terrestrial animals
8705: breathing dry air, but we have the fact of the water-spider conquering
8706: the under-water world. There are a few spiders about the seashore, and a
8707: few that can survive douching with freshwater, but the particular case
8708: of the true water-spider, _Argyroneta natans_, stands by itself because
8709: the creature, as regards the female at least, has _conquered_ the
8711: the water, and pegged down by threads of silk. Along a special vertical
8712: line the mother spider ascends to the surface and descends again, having
8713: entangled air in the hairs of her body. She brushes off this air
8714: underneath her web, which is thereby buoyed up into a sort of dome. She
8715: does this over and over again, never getting wet all the time, until the

8755: _inferred_ from the outward behaviour of the creature, and partly
8756: because it is almost impossible to avoid reading ourselves into the much
8765: animal, like Brer Rabbit--who, by the way, was the hare--with human
8766: qualities. The other extreme is that of thinking of the animal as if it
8767: were an automatic machine, in the working of which there is no place or
8768: use for mind. Both these extremes are to be avoided.
8770: When Professor Whitman took the eggs of the Passenger Pigeon (which
8771: became extinct not long ago with startling rapidity) and placed them a
8772: few inches to one side of the nest, the bird looked a little uneasy and
8774: there. But she did not try to retrieve her eggs, close at hand as they
8775: were. In a short time she flew away altogether. This shows that the mind
8776: of the pigeon is in some respects very different from the mind of man.

8799: muscle-cells which come into activity almost as easily as the beating of
8800: the heart. In a minute or two the newborn pigling creeps close to its
8801: mother and sucks milk. It has not to learn how to do this any more than
8804: things. In simple cases of these inborn pre-arrangements we speak of
8806: the caution is this, that while these inborn capacities usually work
8807: well in natural conditions, they sometimes work badly when the ordinary
8810: two inches away. But it would be a mistake to call the pigeon, because
8811: of this, an unutterably stupid bird. We have only to think of the
8814: handed over to instinct, and go badly agee when the normal routine is
8815: disturbed. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the enregistered
8816: instinctive capacities work well, and the advantage of their becoming
8817: stereotyped was to leave the animal more free for adventures at a higher
8818: level. Being "a slave of instinct" may give the animal a security that

8837: to Patagonia. Many have no pouch and carry their numerous young ones on
8838: their back, the tail of the young twined round that of the mother. The
8840: lying inert just as if they were dead.]
8849: In many cases two or three females use the same nest, the stickleback
8850: being polygamous. Above the nest the male, who mounts guard, is seen
8854: avoid a blow from a rebounding branch, we do not will the action; and
8855: this is more or less the case, probably, when a young mammal sucks its
8856: mother for the first time. Some Mound-birds of Celebes lay their eggs in
8857: warm volcanic ash by the shore of the sea, others in a great mass of
8858: fermenting vegetation; it is inborn in the newly hatched bird to
8861: that the trigger of the instinct cannot be pulled twice. Similarly, when
8862: the eggs of the turtle, that have been laid in the sand of the shore,
8863: hatch out, the young ones make _instinctively_ for the sea. Some of the
8864: crocodiles bury their eggs two feet or so below the surface among sand
8865: and decaying vegetation--an awkward situation for a birthplace. When the
8866: young crocodile is ready to break out of the egg-shell, just as a chick
8867: does at the end of the three weeks of brooding, it utters
8868: _instinctively_ a piping cry. On hearing this, the watchful mother digs
8869: away the heavy blankets, otherwise the young crocodile would be buried
8870: alive at birth. Now there is no warrant for believing that the young
8872: appreciation of what they do when they are hatched. They act
8873: instinctively, "as to the manner born." But this is not to say that
8874: their activity is not backed by endeavour or even suffused with a
8877: of the mental side of instinctive behaviour.
8879: In many of the higher reaches of animal instinct, as in courtship or
8880: nest-building, in hunting or preparing the food, it looks as if the
8881: starting of the routine activity also "rang up" the higher centres of
8882: the brain and put the intelligence on the _qui vive_, ready to interpose
8883: when needed. So the twofold caution is this: (1) We must not depreciate
8884: the creature too much if, in unusual circumstances, it acts in an
8886: to instinct; and (2) we must leave open the possibility that even
8895: But how are we to know when to credit the animal with intelligence and
8897: the effective action, like opening the mouth the very instant it is
8898: touched by food in the mother's beak, is just a physiological action
8899: like coughing or sneezing, and when there is behind it--a mind at work?
8901: Morgan, who may be called the founder of comparative psychology, that we
8902: must describe the piece of behaviour very carefully, just as it
8906: niggardly, for the behaviour may have a mental subtlety that we have
8908: sound. It is the critical, scientific way.
8910: Bearing this law in mind, let us take a survey of the emergence of mind
8916: Fishes cannot shut their eyes, having no true lids; but the eyes
8917: themselves are very well developed and the vision is acute, especially
8918: for moving objects. Except in gristly fishes, the external opening to
8919: the ear has been lost, so that sound-waves and coarser vibrations must
8920: influence the inner ear, which is well developed, through the
8921: surrounding flesh and bones. It seems that the main use of the ear in
8923: however, the sense of hearing has been demonstrated; thus fishes will
8924: come to the side of a pond to be fed when a bell is rung or when a
8925: whistle is blown by someone not visible from the water. The fact that
8927: they are deaf, for an animal may hear a sound and yet remain quite
8928: indifferent or irresponsive. This merely means that the sound has no
8929: vital interest for the animal. Some fishes, such as bullhead and
8930: dogfish, have a true sense of smell, detecting by their nostrils very
8931: dilute substances permeating the water from a distance. Others, such as
8932: members of the cod family, perceive their food in part at least by the
8935: the fins as well as about the mouth. At this low level the senses of
8937: of the sensitive line or lateral line seen on each side of a bony fish
8938: is to make the animal aware of slow vibrations and changes of pressure
8939: in the water. The skin responds to pressures, the ear to vibrations of
8940: high frequency; the lateral line is between the two in its function.
8945: The brain of the ordinary bony fish is at a very low level. Thus the
8946: cerebral hemispheres, destined to become more and more the seat of
8948: sharks, the brain is much more promising. But although the state of the
8957: or salt water; the larger fifteen-spined stickleback is entirely marine.
8958: In all three species the male fish makes a nest, in fresh or brackish
8959: water in the first two cases, in shore-pools in the third case. The
8960: little species use the leaves and stems of water-plants; the larger
8962: together and fastened by glue-like threads, secreted, strange to say, by
8963: the kidneys. It is just as if a temporary diseased condition had been
8964: regularised and turned to good purpose. Going through the nest several
8965: times, the male makes a little room in the middle. Partly by coercion
8966: and partly by coaxing he induces a female--first one and then
8967: another--to pass through the nest with two doors, depositing eggs during
8968: her short sojourn. The females go their way, and the male mounts guard
8969: over the nest. He drives off intruding fishes much bigger than himself.
8970: When the young are hatched, the male has for a time much to do, keeping
8971: his charges within bounds until they are able to move about with
8973: breeding only once; and it is reasonable to suppose that their success
8974: as a race depends to some extent on the paternal care. Now if we could
8975: believe that the nesting behaviour had appeared suddenly in its present
8976: form, we should be inclined to credit the fish with considerable mental
8977: ability. But we are less likely to be so generous if we reflect that the
8978: routine has been in all likelihood the outcome of a long racial process
8979: of slight improvements and critical testings. The secretion of the glue
8981: perhaps discovered by accident; the types that had wit enough to take
8982: advantage of this were most successful; the routine became enregistered

9013: Their wings have been turned into flippers for swimming in the sea and
9015: trackless waste to their birthplace, where they breed. When they reach
9016: the Antarctic shore they walk with determination to a suitable site,
9017: often at the top of a steep cliff. Some species waddle 130 steps per

9026: After the fishes had become quite at home in their artificial
9027: surroundings, their lessons began. Cloth packets, one of which contained
9028: meat and the other cotton, were suspended at opposite ends of the
9029: aquarium. The mud-minnows did not show that they perceived either
9030: packet, though they swam close by them; the sticklebacks were intrigued
9031: at once. Those that went towards the packet containing meat darted
9033: went towards the cotton packet turned sharply away when they were within
9034: about two inches off. They then perceived what those at the other end
9035: were after and joined them--a common habit amongst fishes. Although the
9036: minnows were not interested in the tiny "bags of mystery," they were
9037: even more alert than the sticklebacks in perceiving moving objects in or
9038: on the water, and there is no doubt that both these shallow-water
9039: species discover their food largely by sense of sight.
9042: were fed on minced snail, chopped earthworm, fragments of liver, and the
9043: like, and the food was given to them from the end of forceps held above
9044: the surface of the water, so that the fishes could not be influenced by
9045: smell. They had to leap out of the water to take the food from the
9046: forceps. Discs of coloured cardboard were slipped over the end of the
9047: forceps, so that what the fishes saw was a morsel of food in the centre
9048: of a coloured disc. After a week or so of preliminary training, they
9049: were so well accustomed to the coloured discs that the presentation of
9050: one served as a signal for the fishes to dart to the surface and spring
9051: out of the water. When baits of paper were substituted for the food, the
9052: fishes continued to jump at the discs. When, however, a blue disc was
9053: persistently used for the paper bait and a red disc for the real food,
9054: or _vice versa_, some of the minnows learned to discriminate infallibly
9055: between shadow and substance, both when these were presented alternately
9056: and when they were presented simultaneously. This is not far from the
9059: In the course of a few lessons, both minnows and sticklebacks learned to
9060: associate particular colours with food, and other associations were also
9062: repeated trials was subsequently ignored. The approach of the
9064: can be no doubt that in the ordinary life of fishes there is a process
9067: given the power of forming associations such as those we have
9069: certain lines, fishes do not require much more. And in truth they have
9071: that supports them and is very uniform and constant, able in most cases
9074: great abundance so that the huge infantile mortality hardly counts,
9075: rarely dying a natural death but usually coming with their strength
9076: unabated to a violent end, fishes hold their own in the struggle for
9077: existence without much in the way of mental endowment. Their brain has
9078: more to do with motion than with mentality, and they have remained at a
9083: our average, estimate of fishes, we must remember the salmon surmounting
9084: the falls, the wary trout eluding the angler's skill, the common
9085: mud-skipper (Periophthalmus) of many tropical shores which climbs on the
9086: rocks and the roots of the mangrove-trees, or actively hunts small
9087: shore-animals. We must remember the adventurous life-history of the eel
9088: and the quaint ways in which some fishes, males especially, look after
9089: their family. The male sea-horse puts the eggs in his breast-pocket; the
9090: male Kurtus carries them on the top of his head; the cock-paidle or
9091: lumpsucker guards them and aerates them in a corner of a shore-pool.
9098: Towards the end of the age of the Old Red Sandstone or Devonian, a great
9099: step in evolution was taken--the emergence of Amphibians. The earliest
9101: which may be discerned in the tadpoles of our frogs and toads, and there
9102: is no doubt that amphibians sprang from a fish stock. But they made
9103: great strides, associated in part with their attempts to get out of the
9105: soft parts; but if we consider the living representatives of the class,
9107: toes, a three-chambered heart, true ventral lungs, a drum to the ear, a
9109: an object and when they began to be able to utter sufficient sounds, two
9111: probably begun before the end of the Devonian age, amphibians were the
9113: doubtless, as it is to-day in our frogs, a sex-call; but it was the
9114: beginning of what was destined to play a very important part in the
9115: evolution of the mind. In the course of ages the significance of the
9118: among kindred, especially in the dark and in the intricacies of the
9119: forest. Ages passed, and the voice rose on another turn of the
9120: evolutionary spiral to be expressive of particular emotions beyond the
9122: contentment. Finally, we judge, the animal--perhaps the bird was
9126: the medium of reasoned discourse. Sentences were made and judgments
9127: expressed. But was not the beginning in the croaking of Amphibia?
9132: Frogs have good eyes, and the toad's eyes are "jewels." There is
9133: evidence of precise vision in the neat way in which a frog catches a
9137: while our skin is sensitive to heat rays but not to light, the skin of
9138: the frog answers back to light rays as well. Professor Yerkes
9140: it wished to reach a tank of water. At the first alternative between two
9141: paths, a red card was placed on the wrong side and a white one on the
9142: other. When the frog had learned to take the correct path, marked by the
9143: white card, Prof. Yerkes changed the cards. The confusion of the frog
9147: but the sense of hearing is well developed, more developed than might be
9148: inferred from the indifference that frogs show to almost all sounds
9149: except the croaking of their kindred and splashes in the water.
9152: of the tree-frogs are very alert; but there is very little that we dare
9153: say about the amphibian mind. We have mentioned that frogs may learn the
9155: spawning-pond from a considerable distance. But an examination of their
9156: brains, occupying a relatively small part of the broad, flat skull,
9157: warns us not to expect much intelligence. On the other hand, when we
9158: take frogs along a line that is very vital to them, namely, the
9160: experiment, that they are quick to learn and that they remember their
9161: lessons for many days. Frogs sometimes deposit their eggs in very
9174: zone on the chest. The upper parts are blackish-grey. The harpy occurs
9184: skin to be removed, in the belief that it was dead, before betraying its

9192: inserted nuts for the purposes of cracking the shell and extracting the
9193: kernel, is seen towards the top of the tree. But the taker of the
9195: and it was promptly discovered and used by the bird.]
9200: It must be put to the credit of amphibians that they have made many
9201: experiments in methods of parental care, as if they were feeling their
9202: way to new devices. A common frog lays her clumps of eggs in the cradle
9203: of the water, sometimes far over a thousand together; the toad winds two
9205: all. There is no parental care, and the prolific multiplication covers
9206: the enormous infantile mortality. This is the spawning solution of the
9207: problem of securing the continuance of the race. But there is another
9209: of the number of eggs. Thus the male of the Nurse-Frog (Alytes), not
9210: uncommon on the Continent, fixes a string of twenty to fifty eggs to the
9212: night to get some food and to keep up the moisture about the eggs. In
9213: three weeks, when the tadpoles are ready to come out, he plunges into
9214: the pond and is freed from his living burden and his family cares. In
9215: the case of the thoroughly aquatic Surinam Toad (Pipa), the male helps
9216: to press the eggs, perhaps a hundred in number, on to the back of the
9218: by fully formed young toads jump out of the pockets.
9220: In the South American tree-frogs called Nototrema there is a pouch on
9221: the back of the female in which the eggs develop, and it is interesting
9223: in other species the young emerge as miniatures of their parents.
9224: Strangest of all, perhaps, is the case of Darwin's Frog (Rhinoderma of
9225: Chili), where the young, about ten to fifteen in number, develop in the
9227: Eventually the strange spectacle is seen of miniature frogs jumping out
9228: of their father's mouth. Needless to say we are not citing these methods
9229: of parental care as examples of intelligence; but perhaps they correct
9230: the impression of amphibians as a rather humdrum race. Whatever be the
9231: mental aspect of the facts, there has certainly been some kind of
9232: experimenting, and the increase of parental care, so marked in many
9233: amphibians, with associated reduction of the number of offspring is a
9234: finger-post on the path of progress.
9241: We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
9242: justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
9248: rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
9249: tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
9251: crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
9252: when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
9253: the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
9255: egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
9257: other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
9261: In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
9262: their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
9263: indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise: "Whenever the good
9266: to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
9269: itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
9270: simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
9271: constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
9272: maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
9273: minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
9274: minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
9275: less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
9276: seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
9277: the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
9278: which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
9279: not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
9280: from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
9285: of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
9286: feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
9287: be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
9290: intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
9291: adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
9292: seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
9295: from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
9296: egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
9297: downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
9298: contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
9306: Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
9307: pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
9308: for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
9309: the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
9310: which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
9312: from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
9313: their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
9316: To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
9317: second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
9318: the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
9319: respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
9320: parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
9321: as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
9322: They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
9323: the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
9324: instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
9325: sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
9326: It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
9327: part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
9333: more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
9334: trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
9335: the autumn gales will do the rest.]
9341: The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
9342: against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
9344: Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
9346: As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
9347: bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
9348: for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
9349: developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
9353: that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
9354: carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
9355: credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
9356: gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
9357: recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
9358: There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
9359: sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
9361: students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
9362: their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
9363: gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
9369: tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
9371: by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
9372: seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
9373: capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
9374: bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
9376: that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
9377: reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
9378: observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
9379: instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
9380: she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
9381: from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
9382: even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
9383: peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
9384: the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
9385: twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
9387: Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
9388: limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
9389: the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
9391: rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
9392: obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
9393: mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
9395: of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
9397: hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
9398: enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
9400: Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
9402: in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
9405: birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
9406: The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
9413: in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
9414: not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
9415: day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
9416: stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
9417: feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
9419: the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
9420: had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
9422: There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
9424: diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
9426: of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
9427: course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
9428: capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
9431: with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
9435: nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
9436: purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
9437: "nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
9438: result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
9440: caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
9441: days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
9442: the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
9443: capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
9446: have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
9448: one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
9449: where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
9451: monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
9452: is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of

9511: animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
9512: are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
9513: mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying

9637: a particular order, and yet many mammals master the problem. What is
9638: plain is that they gradually eliminate useless movements, that they make
9639: fewer and fewer mistakes, that they eventually succeed, and that they
9640: register the solution within themselves so that it remains with them for

9702: The answer is that most mammals have become in the course of time very
9703: well adapted to the ordinary conditions of their life, and tend to leave
9704: well alone. They have got their repertory of efficient answers to the
9705: ordinary questions of everyday life, and why should they experiment? In

9707: efficiency in normal circumstances, and therefore even the higher
9709: are extraordinarily efficient, they tend to be a little dull. Their

9731: playing period is much more; it is one of the few opportunities animals
9734: (behaviour-variations) which may form part of the raw materials of
9735: progress. Play, we repeat, gives us a glimpse of the possibilities of
9736: the mammal mind.

9742: vanishing mammals, like the beaver, not even this can be said. Humdrum
9744: that in the play of young mammals there is an indication of unexhausted
9745: possibilities, and we get the same impression when we think of three
9746: other facts. (_a_) In those mammals, like dog and horse, which have
9747: entered into active cooperative relations with man, we see that the mind
9748: of the mammal is capable of much more than the average would lead us to
9749: think. When man's sheltering is too complete and the domesticated
9750: creature is passive in his grip, the intelligence deteriorates. (_b_)
9751: When we study mammals, like the otter, which live a versatile life in a
9753: the play of wits. (_c_) Thirdly, when we pass to monkeys, where the
9754: fore-limb has become a free hand, where the brain shows a relatively
9756: recognise the emergence of something new--a restless inquisitiveness, a
9757: desire to investigate the world, an unsatisfied tendency to experiment.
9758: We are approaching the Dawn of Reason.
9765: There is a long gamut between the bushy-tailed, almost squirrel-like
9766: marmosets and the big-brained chimpanzee. There is great variety of
9767: attainment at different levels in the Simian tribe.
9772: To begin at the beginning, it is certain that monkeys have a first-class
9774: axes of the two eyes are directed forwards as in man, and a large
9775: section of the field of vision is common to both eyes. In other words,
9776: monkeys have a more complete stereoscopic vision than the rest of the
9778: different colours, apart from different degrees of brightness in the
9779: coloured objects. They are quick to discriminate differences in the
9781: if the prize is always put in a box of the same shape they soon learn
9782: (by association) to select the profitable one. They learn to
9783: discriminate cards with short words or with signs printed on them,
9784: coming down when the "Yes" card is shown, remaining on their perch when
9785: the card says "No." Bred to a forest life where alertness is a
9786: life-or-death quality, they are quick to respond to a sudden movement or
9787: to pick out some new feature in their surroundings. And what is true of
9793: Another quality which separates monkeys very markedly from ordinary
9794: mammals is their manipulative expertness, the co-ordination of hand
9795: and eye. This great gift follows from the fact that among monkeys the
9799: monkeys at all is aware of the zest with which they use their tool. They
9800: enjoy pulling things to pieces--a kind of dissection--or screwing the

9860: This applies to mental activity as well, and the quality is one of
9861: extraordinary interest, for it shows the experimenting mood at a higher
9862: turn of the spiral than in any other creature, save man. It points
9863: forward to the scientific spirit. We cannot, indeed, believe in the
9864: sudden beginning of any quality, and we recall the experimenting of

9974: (3) of remembering the solution when it was discovered. Kinnaman taught

10010: employed to move the food within reach, but although the act was

10038: think of a stream with currents at different levels. Lowest there are
10039: the _basal appetites_ of hunger and sex, often with eddies rising to the
10040: surface. Then there are the _primary emotions_, such as fear of
10041: hereditary enemies and maternal affection for offspring. Above these are
10043: having to learn how. But in mammals these are often expressed along
10044: with, or as it were through, the controlled life of _intelligent
10045: activity_, where there is more clear-cut perceptual influence.
10051: An African ape, at home in the equatorial forests, a lively and playful
10065: One of the most resourceful of animals and the "most playsomest crittur
10066: on God's earth." It neither stores nor hibernates, but survives in
10067: virtue of its wits and because of the careful education of the young.
10071: Higher still are the records or memories of individual experience and
10072: the registration of individual habits, while on the surface is the
10073: instreaming multitude of messages from the outside world, like raindrops
10074: and hailstones on the stream, some of them penetrating deeply, being, as
10075: we say, full of meaning. The mind of the higher animal is in some
10076: respects like a child's mind, in having little in the way of clear-cut
10077: ideas, in showing no reason in the strict sense, and in its
10078: extraordinary educability, but it differs from the child's mind entirely
10079: in the sure effectiveness of a certain repertory of responses. It is
10083: "Until at last arose the Man."
10085: Man's brain is more complicated than that of the higher apes--gorilla,
10086: orang, and chimpanzee--and it is relatively larger. But the improvements
10087: in structure do not seem in themselves sufficient to account for man's
10091: have--there is conceptual inference--or _Reason_--an internal
10092: experimenting with general ideas. Even the cleverest animals, it would
10096: may be, however, that "percepts" and "concepts" differ rather in degree
10097: than in kind, and that the passage from one to the other meant a higher
10099: percept of man, as distinguished from a memory-image of the particular
10100: men it has known, but man alone has the concept Man, or Mankind, or
10109: distinctive is not the vocabulary so much as the habit of making
10112: much, the use of words as symbols of general ideas meant even more, for
10113: it meant the possibility of playing the internal game of thinking; but
10114: perhaps the most important advance of all was the means of comparing
10117: himself the gains of the past. It is not without significance that the
10118: Greek Logos, which may be translated "the word," may also be translated
10128: creatures act experimentally on their surroundings. From the beginning
10129: this twofold process has been going on, receiving stimuli from the
10130: environment and acting upon the environment, and according to the
10131: efficiency of the reactions and actions living creatures have been
10133: new gateways of knowledge--the senses, which are far more than five in
10134: number. The other main line of advance has been in most general terms,
10136: another till a door is unlocked. There is progress in multiplying the
10137: gateways of knowledge and making them more discriminating, and there is
10138: progress in making the modes of experimenting more wide-awake, more
10139: controlled, and more resolute. But behind both of these is the
10140: characteristically vital power of enregistering within the organism the
10141: lessons of the past. In the life of the individual these enregistrations
10142: are illustrated by memories and habituations and habits; in the life of
10143: the race they are illustrated by reflex actions and instinctive
10149: We must not shirk the very difficult question of the relation between
10150: the bodily and the mental side of behaviour.
10152: (_a_) Some great thinkers have taught that the mind is a reality by
10153: itself which plays upon the instrument of the brain and body. As the
10154: instrument gets worn and dusty the playing is not so good as it once
10155: was, but the player is still himself. This theory of the essential
10156: independence of the mind is a very beautiful one, but those who like it
10157: when applied to themselves are not always so fond of it when it is
10158: applied to other intelligent creatures like rooks and elephants. It may
10159: be, however, that there is a gradual emancipation of the mind which has
10160: gone furthest in Man and is still progressing.
10162: (_b_) Some other thinkers have taught that the inner life of thought and
10163: feeling is only, as it were, an echo of the really important
10164: activity--that of the body and brain. Ideas are just foam-bells on the
10166: our physiological life. To most of us this theory is impossible, because
10168: translated into matter and motion, are the clearest realities in our
10169: experience, and that they count for good and ill all through our life.
10170: They are more than the tickings of the clock; they make the wheels go
10173: (_c_) There are others who think that the most scientific position is
10174: simply to recognise both the bodily and the mental activities as equally
10175: important, and so closely interwoven that they cannot be separated.
10176: Perhaps they are just the outer and the inner aspects of one
10177: reality--the life of the creature. Perhaps they are like the concave and
10178: convex curves of a dome, like the two sides of a shield. Perhaps the
10179: life of the organism is always a unity, at one time appearing more
10180: conspicuously as Mind-body, at another time as Body-mind. The most
10181: important fact is that neither aspect can be left out. By no jugglery
10184: the beginning was Mind. This is in accordance with Aristotle's saying
10185: that there is nothing in the end which was not also in kind present in
10186: the beginning--whatever we mean by beginning.
10191: What has led to the truly wonderful result which we admire in a creature
10194: which is good. New departures occur and these are tested for what they
10195: are worth. Idiosyncrasies crop up and they are sifted. New cards come
10196: mysteriously from within into the creature's hand, and they are
10197: played--for better or for worse. So by new variations and their sifting,
10198: by experimenting and enregistering the results, the mind has gradually
10214: Most people have heard of the oriental race which puzzled over the
10215: foundations of the universe, and decided that it must be supported on
10216: the back of a giant elephant. But the elephant? They put it on the back
10217: of a monstrous tortoise, and there they let the matter end. If every
10218: animal in nature had been called upon, they would have been no nearer a
10221: composed of the earth and the great canopy over the earth which they
10222: called the sky. They left it, as a whole, floating in nothing. And in
10223: this the ancients were wiser than they knew. Things do not fall down
10224: unless they are pulled down by that mysterious force which we call
10225: gravitation. The earth, it is true, is pulled by the sun, and would fall
10226: into it; but the earth escapes this fiery fate by circulating at great
10227: speed round the sun. The stars pull each other; but it has already been
10228: explained that they meet this by travelling rapidly in gigantic orbits.
10229: Yet we do, in a new sense of the word, need foundations of the universe.
10230: Our mind craves for some explanation of the matter out of which the
10232: Chemistry. Both these sciences study, under different aspects, matter
10233: and energy; and between them they have put together a conception of the
10234: fundamental nature of things which marks an epoch in the history of
10240: The Bricks of the Cosmos
10242: More than two thousand years ago the first men of science, the Greeks of
10243: the cities of Asia Minor, speculated on the nature of matter. You can
10246: long as you have got apparatus fine enough for the work. But there must
10247: be a limit, these Greeks said, and so they supposed that all matter was
10249: the meaning of the Greek word "atom."
10251: Like so many other ideas of these brilliant early Greek thinkers, the
10253: atoms. But science was then so young that the way in which the Greeks
10254: applied the idea was not very profound. A liquid or a gas, they said,
10255: consisted of round, smooth atoms, which would not cling together. Then
10256: there were atoms with rough surfaces, "hooky" surfaces, and these stuck
10257: together and formed solids. The atoms of iron or marble, for instance,
10258: were so very hooky that, once they got together, a strong man could not
10259: tear them apart. The Greeks thought that the explanation of the universe
10260: was that an infinite number of these atoms had been moving and mixing in
10262: on the particular combination which is our universe.
10265: only to be advanced again in various ways. It was the famous Manchester
10266: chemist, John Dalton, who restored it in the early years of the
10267: nineteenth century. He first definitely formulated the atomic theory as
10268: a scientific hypothesis. The whole physical and chemical science of that
10269: century was now based upon the atom, and it is quite a mistake to
10271: the smallest particle of a chemical element. No one has ever seen an
10272: atom. Even the wonderful new microscope which has just been invented
10274: smaller than the breadth of a hair; for that is the size of atoms. We
10275: can weigh them and measure them, though they are invisible, and we know
10276: that all matter is composed of them. It is a new discovery that atoms
10277: are not indivisible. They consist themselves of still smaller particles,
10278: as we shall see. But the atoms exist all the same, and we may still say
10279: that they are the bricks of which the material universe is built.
10286: as Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge. The
10287: modern theory of the structure of the atom is largely due to him.]
10293: One of the greatest scientific men who have ever lived. He
10294: revolutionised physics with his electro-magnetic theory of light, and
10295: practically all modern researches have had their origin, direct or
10296: indirect, in his work. Together with Faraday he constitutes one of the
10297: main scientific glories of the nineteenth century.]
10303: Sir William Crookes experimented on the electric discharge in vacuum
10304: tubes and described the phenomena as a "fourth state of matter." He was
10305: actually observing the flight of electrons, but he did not fully
10306: appreciate the nature of his experiments.]
10312: One of the most distinguished physicists of the present day.]
10314: But if we had some magical glass by means of which we could see into the
10315: structure of material things, we should not see the atoms put evenly
10316: together as bricks are in a wall. As a rule, two or more atoms first
10317: come together to form a larger particle, which we call a "molecule."
10318: Single atoms do not, as a rule, exist apart from other atoms; if a
10319: molecule is broken up, the individual atoms seek to unite with other
10320: atoms of another kind or amongst themselves. For example, three atoms of
10322: atom of oxygen form water. It is molecules that form the mass of matter;
10324: atoms are the bricks.
10326: In this way we get a useful first view of the material things we handle.
10327: In a liquid the molecules of the liquid cling together loosely. They
10328: remain together as a body, but they roll over and away from each other.
10329: There is "cohesion" between them, but it is less powerful than in a
10330: solid. Put some water in a kettle over the lighted gas, and presently
10331: the tiny molecules of water will rush through the spout in a cloud of
10332: steam and scatter over the kitchen. The heat has broken their bond of
10333: association and turned the water into something like a gas; though we
10334: know that the particles will come together again, as they cool, and form
10337: In a gas the molecules have full individual liberty. They are in a
10338: state of violent movement, and they form no union with each other. If we
10339: want to force them to enter into the loose sort of association which
10340: molecules have in a liquid, we have to slow down their individual
10343: temperature. In _very_ severe cold, on the other hand, the air will
10344: spontaneously become liquid. Some day, when the fires of the sun have
10345: sunk very low, the temperature of the earth will be less than -200° C.:
10347: freezing-point. It will sink to the temperature of the moon. Our
10348: atmosphere will then be an ocean of liquid air, 35 feet deep, lying upon
10349: the solidly frozen masses of our water-oceans.
10351: In a solid the molecules cling firmly to each other. We need a force
10352: equal to twenty-five tons to tear asunder the molecules in a bar of iron
10353: an inch thick. Yet the structure is not "solid" in the popular sense of
10354: the word. If you put a piece of solid gold in a little pool of mercury,
10355: the gold will take in the mercury _between_ its molecules, as if it were
10357: what we usually mean by "solid"; though the molecules are not fixed,
10358: like the bars of a lattice-work, but are in violent motion; they vibrate
10359: about equilibrium positions. If we could see right into the heart of a
10360: bit of the hardest steel, we should see billions of separate molecules,
10361: at some distance from each other, all moving rapidly to and fro.
10365: very fine suspended particles, the particles were in constant movement.
10366: Under a powerful microscope these particles are seen to be violently
10367: agitated; they are each independently darting hither and thither
10369: bounding about in all directions. Thousands of times a second these
10371: incessant colliding of one molecule with another is the normal
10372: condition of affairs; not one of them is at rest. The reason for this
10373: has been worked out, and it is now known that these particles move about
10374: because they are being incessantly bombarded by the molecules of the
10375: liquid. The molecules cannot, of course, be seen, but the fact of their
10376: incessant movement is revealed to the eye by the behaviour of the
10377: visible suspended particles. This incessant movement in the world of
10378: molecules is called the Brownian movement, and is a striking proof of
10379: the reality of molecular motions.
10386: The exploration of this wonder-world of atoms and molecules by the
10387: physicists and chemists of to-day is one of the most impressive triumphs
10388: of modern science. Quite apart from radium and electrons and other
10389: sensational discoveries of recent years, the study of ordinary matter is
10390: hardly inferior, either in interest or audacity, to the work of the
10391: astronomer. And there is the same foundation in both cases--marvellous
10392: apparatus, and trains of mathematical reasoning that would have
10393: astonished Euclid or Archimedes. Extraordinary, therefore, as are some
10394: of the facts and figures we are now going to give in connection with the
10395: minuteness of atoms and molecules, let us bear in mind that we owe them
10396: to the most solid and severe processes of human thought.
10398: Yet the principle can in most cases be made so clear that the reader
10402: measured cube of gold into a leaf six inches square, the mathematician
10403: can tell the thickness of that leaf without measuring it. As a matter of
10405: inches square. Now the mathematician can easily find that when a single
10406: grain of gold is beaten out to that size, the leaf must be 1/367,000 of
10407: an inch thick, or about a thousand times thinner than the paper on
10408: which these words are printed; yet the leaf must be several molecules
10412: with a new interest to that toy of our boyhood the soap-bubble. If you
10413: carefully examine one of these delicate films of soapy water, you notice
10414: certain dark spots or patches on them. These are their thinnest parts,
10415: and by two quite independent methods--one using electricity and the
10416: other light--we have found that at these spots the bubble is less than
10417: the three-millionth of an inch thick! But the molecules in the film
10418: cling together so firmly that they must be at least twenty or thirty
10419: deep in the thinnest part. A molecule, therefore, must be far less than
10420: the three-millionth of an inch thick.
10422: We found next that a film of oil on the surface of water may be even
10423: thinner than a soap-bubble. Professor Perrin, the great French authority
10424: on atoms, got films of oil down to the fifty-millionth of an inch in
10426: the exact limits of the area of the oil-sheet by blowing upon the water
10427: a fine powder which spread to the edge of the film and clearly outlined
10428: it. The rest is safe and simple calculation, as in the case of the
10433: Innumerable methods have been tried, and the result is always the same.
10435: obviously means that the grain contains billions of molecules which
10436: spread through the water. A grain of musk will scent a room--pour
10439: the minuteness of the ultimate particles of matter, and some of these
10440: enable us to give definite figures. On a careful comparison of the best
10441: methods we can say that the average molecule of matter is less than
10442: the 1/125,000,000 of an inch in diameter. In a single cubic centimetre
10443: of air--a globule about the size of a small marble--there are thirty
10444: million trillion molecules. And since the molecule is, as we saw, a
10445: group or cluster of atoms, the atom itself is smaller. Atoms, for
10446: reasons which we shall see later, differ very greatly from each other in
10447: size and weight. It is enough to say that some of them are so small that
10448: it would take 400,000,000 of them, in a line, to cover an inch of space;
10451: the diameter of a full stop.
10453: [Illustration: An atom is the smallest particle of a chemical element.
10454: Two or more atoms come together to form a molecule: thus molecules form
10455: the mass of matter. A molecule of water is made up of two atoms of
10457: therefore, are of different sizes according to the number and kind of
10458: the particular atoms of which they are composed. A starch molecule

10466: The molecules, which are inconceivably small, are, on the other hand, so
10470: times round the earth.]

10486: A diagram, constructed from actual observations, showing the erratic
10488: bombarded by the molecules of the liquid. This movement is called the
10489: Brownian movement, and it furnishes a striking illustration of the truth
10490: of the theory that the molecules of a body are in a state of continual

10501: of this energy has been discovered in the last twenty years, but it is
10502: well to realise that the atoms themselves have stupendous energy. The
10504: piece of cold iron you hold in your hand, the bit of brick you pick up,
10505: or the penny you take from your pocket is a colossal reservoir of
10506: energy, since it consists of trillions of moving atoms. To realise the
10513: the fact that gases spread until they fill every "empty" available space
10514: shows definitely that they consist of small particles travelling at
10515: great speed. The physicist brings his refined methods to bear on these
10516: things, and he measures the energy and velocity of these infinitely
10517: minute molecules. He tells us that molecules of oxygen, at the
10518: temperature of melting ice, travel at the rate of about 500 yards a
10520: travel at four times that speed, or three times the speed with which a
10521: bullet leaves a rifle. Each molecule of the air, which seems so still in
10522: the house on a summer's day, is really travelling faster than a rifle
10523: bullet does at the beginning of its journey. It collides with another
10526: could stop the molecules of hydrogen gas, and utilise their energy, as
10527: we utilise the energy of steam or the energy of the water at Niagara, we
10531: I have used for comparison the speed of a rifle bullet, and in an
10533: estimate this. It is, of course, easy. We put two screens in the path of
10534: the bullet, one near the rifle and the other some distance away. We
10535: connect them electrically and use a fine time-recording machine, and the
10536: bullet itself registers the time it takes to travel from the first to
10537: the second screen.
10539: Now this is very simple and superficial work in comparison with the
10540: system of exact and minute measurements which the physicist and chemist
10542: photograph of two exactly equal pieces of paper in the opposite pans of
10543: a fine balance. A single word has been written in pencil on one of these
10545: the scale! The spectroscope will detect a quantity of matter four
10546: million times smaller even than this; and the electroscope is a million
10547: times still more sensitive than the spectroscope. We have a
10548: heat-measuring instrument, the bolometer, which makes the best
10549: thermometer seem Early Victorian. It records the millionth of a degree
10550: of temperature. It is such instruments, multiplied by the score,
10551: which enable us to do the fine work recorded in these pages.
10558: The iridescent colours sometimes seen on a soap bubble, as in the
10560: glass blown into extremely fine bulbs, on the wings of dragon-flies and
10561: the surface of oily water. The different colours correspond to different
10562: thicknesses of the surface. Part of the light which strikes these thin
10563: coatings is reflected from the upper surface, but another part of the
10564: light penetrates the transparent coating and is reflected from the lower
10565: surface. It is the mixture of these two reflected rays, their
10566: "interference" as it is called, which produces the colours observed. The
10567: "black spots" on a soap bubble are the places where the soapy film is
10568: thinnest. At the black spots the thickness of the bubble is about the
10569: three-millionth part of an inch. If the whole bubble were as thin as
10579: But these wonders of the atom are only a prelude to the more romantic
10580: and far-reaching discoveries of the new physics--the wonders of the
10581: electron. Another and the most important phase of our exploration of the
10582: material universe opened with the discovery of radium in 1898.
10584: In the discovery of radio-active elements, a new property of matter was
10585: discovered. What followed on the discovery of radium and of the X-rays
10588: As Sir Ernest Rutherford, one of our greatest authorities, recently
10589: said, the new physics has dissipated the last doubt about the reality of
10592: not take the word now in its original Greek meaning (an "indivisible"
10596: The discovery that the atom was composed of smaller particles was the
10597: welcome realisation of a dream that had haunted the imagination of the
10598: nineteenth century. Chemists said that there were about eighty different
10600: the multiplicity. Science is always aiming at simplicity and unity. It
10601: may be that science has now taken a long step in the direction of
10602: explaining the fundamental unity of all the matter. The chemist was
10603: unable to break up these "elements" into something simpler, so he called
10604: their atoms "indivisible" in that sense. But one man of science after
10605: another expressed the hope that we would yet discover some fundamental
10606: matter of which the various atoms were composed--_one primordial
10607: substance from which all the varying forms of matter have been evolved
10608: or built up_. Prout suggested this at the very beginning of the century,
10609: when atoms were rediscovered by Dalton. Father Secchi, the famous Jesuit
10610: astronomer said that all the atoms were probably evolved from ether; and
10612: "prothyl" as the fundamental substance. Others thought hydrogen was the
10613: stuff out of which all the other atoms were composed.
10615: The work which finally resulted in the discovery of radium began with
10617: the eighties.
10620: electric charge was sent through a vacuum tube--the walls of the glass
10622: from which nearly all the air has been pumped, although we can never
10623: completely empty the tube. Crookes used such ingenious methods that he
10624: reduced the gas in his tubes until it was twenty million times thinner
10625: than the atmosphere. He then sent an electric discharge through, and got
10626: very remarkable results. The negative pole of the electric current (the
10627: "cathode") _gave off rays which faintly lit the molecules of the thin
10628: gas in the tube_, and caused a pretty fluorescence on the glass walls of
10629: the tube. What were these Rays? Crookes at first thought they
10630: corresponded to a "new or fourth state of matter." Hitherto we had only
10631: been familiar with matter in the three conditions of solid, liquid, and
10634: Now Crookes really had the great secret under his eyes. But about twenty
10635: years elapsed before the true nature of these rays was finally and
10637: "that the rays consisted of a stream of negatively charged particles
10639: second. In addition, it was found that the mass of each particle was
10640: exceedingly small, about 1/1800 of the mass of a hydrogen atom, the
10641: lightest atom known to science." _These particles or electrons, as they
10642: are now called, were being liberated from the atom._ The atoms of matter
10645: the particles of the gas were electrified and hurled against the walls
10646: of the tube. He said that it was ordinary matter in a new
10647: state--"radiant matter." Another distinguished man of science, Lenard,
10648: found that, when he fitted a little plate of aluminum in the glass wall
10649: of the tube, the mysterious rays passed through this as if it were a
10650: window. They must be waves in the ether, he said.
10656: In the left-hand photograph the two pieces of paper exactly balance. The
10657: balance used is very sensitive, and when the single word "atoms" has
10658: been written with a lead pencil upon one of the papers the additional
10659: weight is sufficient to depress one of the pans as shown in the second
10660: photograph. The spectroscope will detect less than one-millionth of the
10661: matter contained in the word pencilled above.]
10668: Note the pieces of shrapnel which are revealed.]
10678: Note the fine details revealed, down to the metal tags of the bootlace
10679: and the nails in the heel of the boot.]
10686: So the story went on from year to year. We shall see in a moment to what
10687: it led. Meanwhile the next great step was when, in 1895, Röntgen
10688: discovered the X-rays, which are now known to everybody. He was
10689: following up the work of Lenard, and he one day covered a "Crookes tube"
10691: which was near the tube began to glow. _The rays had gone through the
10692: black stuff; and on further experiment he found that they would go
10694: short time the world was astonished to learn that we could photograph
10695: the skeleton in a living man's body, locate a penny in the interior of a
10699: And what are these X-rays? They are not a form of matter; they are not
10701: with a remarkable power of penetration. We have seen what the
10702: spectroscope reveals about the varying nature of light wave-lengths.
10703: Light-waves are set up by vibrations in ether,[2] and, as we shall see,
10704: these ether disturbances are all of the same kind; they only differ as
10705: regards wave-lengths. The X-rays which Röntgen discovered, then, are
10706: light, but a variety of light previously unknown to us; they are ether
10708: directions, as all the world knows, but that we need not discuss at this
10711:     [2] We refer throughout to the "ether" because, although modern
10712:     theories dispense largely with this conception, the theories of
10715:     view will be explained later in the article on Einstein's Theory.
10717: While the world wondered at these marvels, the men of science were
10718: eagerly following up the new clue to the mystery of matter which was
10719: exercising the mind of Crookes and other investigators. In 1896
10720: Becquerel brought us to the threshold of the great discovery.
10722: Certain substances are phosphorescent--they become luminous after they
10724: find if any of these substances give rise to X-rays. One day he chose a
10725: salt of the metal uranium. He was going to see if, after exposing it to
10727: substance. He wrapped it up and laid it aside, to wait for the sun, but
10728: he found the uranium salt did not wait for the sun. Some strong
10729: radiation from it went through the opaque covering and made an
10730: impression of the cross upon the plate underneath. Light or darkness was
10731: immaterial. The mysterious rays streamed night and day from the salt.
10733: producing X-rays; the rays emitted by uranium would penetrate the same
10734: opaque substances as the X-rays discovered by Röntgen.
10739: Now, at the same time as many other investigators, Professor Curie and
10740: his Polish wife took up the search. They decided to find out whether
10741: the emission came from the uranium itself or _from something associated
10742: with it_, and for this purpose they made a chemical analysis of great
10744: was very active, and they analysed tons of it, concentrating always on
10745: the radiant element in it. After a time, as they successively worked out
10746: the non-radiant matter, the stuff began to glow. In the end they
10751: That was the starting-point of the new development of physics and
10752: chemistry. From every laboratory in the world came a cry for radium
10754: workers fastened on the new element. The inquiry was broadened, and, as
10755: year followed year, one substance after another was found to possess the
10763: So, instead of atoms being indivisible, they are actually dividing
10764: themselves, spontaneously, and giving off throughout the universe tiny
10765: fragments of their substance. We shall explain presently what was later
10766: discovered about the electron; meanwhile we can say that every glowing
10767: metal is pouring out a stream of these electrons. Every arc-lamp is
10768: discharging them. Every clap of thunder means a shower of them. Every
10769: star is flooding space with them. We are witnessing the spontaneous
10772: the ultra-violet light which it sends to the earth is one of the most
10773: powerful agencies for releasing electrons from the surface-atoms of
10774: matter on the earth. It is fortunate for us that our atmosphere absorbs
10775: most of this ultra-violet or invisible light of the sun--a kind of light
10777: received the full flood of it from the sun, our metals would
10781: But we are here anticipating, we are going beyond radium to the
10782: wonderful discoveries which were made by the chemists and physicists of
10783: the world who concentrated upon it. The work of Professor and Mme. Curie
10784: was merely the final clue to guide the great search. How it was followed
10785: up, how we penetrated into the very heart of the minute atom and
10788: the next chapter.
10793: What the discovery of radium implied was only gradually realised. Radium
10794: captivated the imagination of the world; it was a boon to medicine, but
10795: to the man of science it was at first a most puzzling and most
10797: dimly unveiled in its wonderful manifestations, and there now
10798: concentrated upon it as gifted a body of men--conspicuous amongst them
10799: Sir J. J. Thomson, Sir Ernest Rutherford, Sir W. Ramsay, and Professor
10801: beyond that of any other age as the _Aquitania_ is beyond a Roman
10802: galley. Within five years the secret was fairly mastered. Not only were
10803: all kinds of matter reduced to a common basis, but the forces of the
10804: universe were brought into a unity and understood as they had never been
10811: electric discharge in the vacuum tube. This discharge travels straight
10812: along the tube, as in the upper diagram. When a magnetic field is
10813: applied, however, the rays are deflected, as shown in the lower diagram.
10814: The similarity of the behaviour of the electric discharge with the
10816: that the two phenomena may be identified. It was by this means that the
10822: larger than the letter "O" there are billions of atoms, whilst an
10823: electron is more than a thousand times smaller than the smallest atom.
10824: How their size is ascertained is described in the text. In this diagram
10825: a bubble of gas is magnified to the size of the world. Adopting this
10826: scale, _each atom_ in the bubble would then be as large as a tennis
10837: electrons into space. Many of these streams encounter the earth, giving
10843: The Discovery of the Electron
10845: Physicists did not take long to discover that the radiation from radium
10846: was very like the radiation in a "Crookes tube." It was quickly
10847: recognised, moreover, that both in the tube and in radium (and other
10848: metals) the atoms of matter were somehow breaking down.
10850: However, the first step was to recognise that there were three distinct
10852: uranium. Sir Ernest Rutherford christened them, after the first three
10853: letters of the Greek alphabet, the Alpha, the Beta, and Gamma rays. We
10854: are concerned chiefly with the second group and purpose here to deal
10858:     gas, shot out at the rate of 12,000 miles a second.
10860: The "Gamma rays" are _waves_, like the X-rays, not material particles.
10861: They appear to be a type of X-rays. They possess the remarkable power of
10862: penetrating opaque substances; they will pass through a foot of solid
10865: The "Beta rays," as they were at first called, have proved to be one of
10866: the most interesting discoveries that science ever made. They proved
10867: what Crookes had surmised about the radiations he discovered in his
10872: the atoms of matter: only when the electron was isolated from the atom
10873: was it recognised for the first time as a separate entity. Electrons,
10874: therefore, are a constituent of the atoms of matter, and we have
10875: discovered that they can be released from the atom by a variety of
10881: three-hundredth of the velocity of light upwards, that is to say, at
10882: least 600 _miles a second, or thereabouts_. Otherwise the electron
10883: sticks to the first atom it meets." These amazing particles may travel
10884: with the enormous velocity of from 10,000 to more than 100,000 miles a
10885: second. It was first learned that they are of an electrical nature,
10886: because they are bent out of their normal path if a magnet is brought
10887: near them. And this fact led to a further discovery: to one of those
10888: sensational estimates which the general public is apt to believe to be
10889: founded on the most abstruse speculations. The physicist set up a little
10890: chemical screen for the "Beta rays" to hit, and he so arranged his tube
10891: that only a narrow sheaf of the rays poured on to the screen. He then
10893: accurately measured the shift of the luminous spot on the screen where
10894: the rays impinged on it. But when he knows the exact intensity of his
10895: magnetic field--which he can control as he likes--and the amount of
10896: deviation it causes, and the mass of the moving particles, he can tell
10897: the speed of the moving particles which he thus diverts. These particles
10898: were being hurled out of the atoms of radium, or from the negative pole
10900: the velocity of light, i.e. nearly 186,000 miles a second.
10903: and another series of experiments enabled physicists to determine the
10904: size of the particles. Only one of these need be described, to give the
10905: reader an idea how men of science arrived at their more startling
10908: Fog, as most people know, is thick in our great cities because the
10909: water-vapour gathers on the particles of dust and smoke that are in the
10910: atmosphere. This fact was used as the basis of some beautiful
10913: gather on. In the end it was possible to cause tiny drops of rain, each
10915: counted. It was a method of counting the quite invisible particles of
10916: dust in the tube; and the method was now successfully applied to the new
10917: rays. Yet another method was to direct a slender stream of the particles
10918: upon a chemical screen. The screen glowed under the cannonade of
10919: particles, and a powerful lens resolved the glow into distinct sparks,
10922: In short, a series of the most remarkable and beautiful experiments,
10923: checked in all the great laboratories of the world, settled the nature
10924: of these so-called rays. They were streams of particles more than a
10925: thousand times smaller than the smallest known atom. The mass of each
10926: particle is, according to the latest and finest measurements 1/1845 of
10928: character except electricity in them, and the name "electrons" has been
10936: electrons are the key to half the mysteries of matter. Electrons in
10938: current," not so long ago regarded as one of the most mysterious
10941: "What a wonder, then, have we here!" says Professor R. K. Duncan. "An
10943: properties utterly beyond even the fanciful imaginings of men of past
10944: time; for nowhere do we find in the records of thought even the hint of
10945: the possibility of things which we now regard as established fact. This
10947: possessing the inconceivable velocity of over 100,000 miles a second, a
10948: velocity sufficient to carry them, if unimpeded, five times around the
10950: times smaller than the smallest atom known to science. Furthermore,
10951: they are charged with negative electricity; they pass straight through
10952: bodies considered opaque with a sublime indifference to the properties
10953: of the body, with the exception of its mere density; they cause bodies
10954: which they strike to shine out in the dark; they affect a photographic
10955: plate; they render the air a conductor of electricity; they cause clouds
10956: in moist air; they cause chemical action and have a peculiar
10957: physiological action. Who, to-day, shall predict the ultimate service to
10958: humanity of the beta-rays from radium!"
10965: The Structure of the Atom
10968: mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
10969: that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
10971: they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
10974: When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
10976: speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
10977: little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
10978: _trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
10979: circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
10980: physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
10982: pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
10983: discards when they will _not_ fit.
10985: At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
10986: two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
10987: Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
10988: an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
10989: Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
10990: round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
10991: round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
10994: these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
10995: is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
10996: attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
10997: equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
10998: This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
10999: electricities in the atom: the positive = the nucleus; the negative =
11000: the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
11001: electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
11002: violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

11017: in a straight path The illustration shows the tortuous path of electrons
11023: light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
11024: deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
11026: our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
11032: But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
11033: contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
11035: charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
11036: electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
11037: violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
11038: in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
11039: will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
11040: the nature of matter.
11042: A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
11043: some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
11044: arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
11045: of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
11046: atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
11047: atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
11049: element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
11050: a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
11051: by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
11052: uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
11053: probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
11054: eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
11055: electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
11056: arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
11063: Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
11064: Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
11066: the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
11068: complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
11071: particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
11073: and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
11074: nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
11077: But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
11078: fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
11080: there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
11082: be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
11083: electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
11085: negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
11086: the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
11087: which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
11088: of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
11089: energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
11092: But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
11093: other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
11094: In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
11096: the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
11097: transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
11099: through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
11102: matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
11103: whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
11105: There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
11107: in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
11108: are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
11109: more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
11111: complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
11114: There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day: are
11115: they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
11116: element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
11117: were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
11118: in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
11120: inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
11121: inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
11122: the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
11123: be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
11124: the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
11125: maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
11126: enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
11127: evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
11128: _evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
11129: reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
11130: built up one from another.
11135: Other New Views
11137: We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
11138: radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
11139: earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
11141: heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
11142: calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
11144: their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
11146: We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
11147: even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
11148: British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
11149: had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
11150: this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
11151: the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
11152: not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
11153: disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
11154: obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
11155: The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
11160: Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
11161: (electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
11162: method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
11163: nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
11164: the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium

11182: atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
11183: move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
11187: The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
11188: of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
11189: X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
11191: As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
11192: to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
11193: physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
11194: outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
11195: ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
11196: however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
11197: thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
11199: in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
11200: commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
11201: three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
11202: may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
11203: an essential "oneness" of the universe.
11210: Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
11217: it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
11218: one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
11221: could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
11223: the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion

11235: or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
11238: difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
11239: was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
11240: or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
11241: fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one

11250:     transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative

11252:     transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the

11255:     become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
11256:     age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
11257:     renaissance of the whole world.
11259: If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
11262: Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
11263: us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
11272: years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
11273: all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
11274: Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
11275: electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
11277: rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
11280: atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
11282: Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
11283: how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
11284: us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
11285: electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
11288: the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
11291: definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
11293: left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
11294: there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
11296:     [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
11297:     days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
11300:     of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
11302:     with more than the normal number of electrons.
11309: The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
11312: a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
11315: generated: such a cell as there is in every house to serve its electric
11318: In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
11321: and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
11322: now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
11323: disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
11324: know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
11325: the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
11327: further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
11328: certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
11329: were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
11330: language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
11331: the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
11332: detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
11333: electrons to pass on to the copper.
11339: passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
11341: faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
11342: 5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
11343: Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the

11375: any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
11378: but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
11379: electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
11381: each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
11382: will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
11383: There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
11384: only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
11386: however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
11391: mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
11393: section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
11395: electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
11397: one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
11398: zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
11399: which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
11400: door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
11401: rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
11402: the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
11404: Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
11405: so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
11406: stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
11407: they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
11412: What the Dynamo does
11414: But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
11415: modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
11416: invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
11417: magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
11418: surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
11419: wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
11420: electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
11423: upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
11425: rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
11426: construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
11428: electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
11429: magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
11430: of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
11431: speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
11432: field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
11434: It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
11435: the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
11436: field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
11441: A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
11443: explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
11445: spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
11446: earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
11448: numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
11449: of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
11450: atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
11451: constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
11452: the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
11453: earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
11454: becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
11456: electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
11457: sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
11458: to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
11468: magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
11470: piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
11471: shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
11472: iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
11473: due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
11474: an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
11477: energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
11478: disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
11480: arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
11481: ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
11482: theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
11483: other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
11484: electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
11485: _proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
11486: research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
11487: compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
11488: affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
11491: connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
11492: consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
11493: the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
11498: Ether and Waves
11501: called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
11502: abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
11503: ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
11504: deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
11505: understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
11506: the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
11507: to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
11508: to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
11509: minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
11511: earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
11512: that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
11513: waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
11515: the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
11517: the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
11518: the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
11519: invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
11520: and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
11521: stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
11522: their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
11523: conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
11524: All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
11526: steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
11527: multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
11535: An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
11536: between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
11537: ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
11538: limit the discharge takes place.]
11544: In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
11545: coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
11546: magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
11547: the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
11548: ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
11551: We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
11554: crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
11556: enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
11557: constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
11558: length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
11559: the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
11561: inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
11562: deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
11563: waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
11564: Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
11565: we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
11566: of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
11567: we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
11570: Below the Limits of Visibility
11572: But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
11573: that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
11574: photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
11575: longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
11576: are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
11577: fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
11579: waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
11580: them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
11581: telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
11582: These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
11583: heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
11584: only as regards their wave-lengths.
11589: If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
11590: gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
11592: the electron: all atoms of matter, as we have seen, are made up of
11594: may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
11601: No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
11603: wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
11604: matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
11605: The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
11606: communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
11607: They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
11608: now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
11609: poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
11611: violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
11612: can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
11613: not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
11615: white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
11616: their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
11617: "blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
11618: waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
11619: there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
11620: which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
11624: has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
11625: planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
11626: Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
11627: moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
11629: cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
11630: and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
11631: easily get the velocity of light.
11633: No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
11635: so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
11636: reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
11638: speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
11639: return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
11640: ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
11641: to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
11642: was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
11643: light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
11645: about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
11650: The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
11651: faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
11652: become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
11653: get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
11655: different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
11656: the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
11657: the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
11658: obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
11659: part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
11660: band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
11661: lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
11662: for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
11663: sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
11664: constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
11665: readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
11666: colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
11667: proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
11668: will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
11669: _omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
11670: appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
11671: to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
11672: that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
11673: permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
11674: that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
11675: of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
11682: In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
11684: another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
11685: photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
11686: flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
11691: Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
11692: differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
11693: Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
11695: wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
11696: length of the wave.]
11700: The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
11701: electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
11702: circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
11703: base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
11707: The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
11708: of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
11709: the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
11710: same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
11711: pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
11715: The Fate of the World
11718: when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
11719: "has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
11720: light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
11721: most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
11722: as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
11724: so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
11726: longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
11727: in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
11728: then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
11729: themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
11730: to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
11732: luminous to them which would be dark to us."
11737: What the Blue "Sky" means
11739: We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
11740: into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
11741: its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
11742: moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
11743: example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
11744: or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
11745: surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
11746: "sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
11747: catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
11748: tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
11749: pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
11750: west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
11751: denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
11752: are sifted out from the other shafts.
11754: Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
11755: and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
11756: there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
11757: _reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
11758: vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
11759: as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
11760: either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
11761: wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
11762: to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
11763: from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
11764: Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
11765: light-waves and let them stream through.
11770: There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
11771: out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
11774: is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
11775: we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
11776: illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
11777: herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
11778: as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
11782: disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
11786: The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
11787: is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
11788: on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
11790: perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
11791: result of the union of the remaining six.]
11793: Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
11794: waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
11797: thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
11798: which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
11799: waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
11800: (chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
11802: fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
11806: The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
11807: waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
11808: minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
11809: physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
11810: made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
11811: is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
11812: the 1/25 of an inch!
11814: One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
11816: is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
11819: calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
11825: As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
11826: of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
11827: energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
11835: what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
11836: matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
11837: the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
11838: is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
11839: in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
11847: ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
11848: burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
11849: _identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
11851: amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
11852: scientific acquisitions of the past century.
11871: A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
11872: more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
11873: equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
11875: one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
11879: The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
11880: is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
11881: on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
11883: perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
11884: result of the union of the remaining six.]
11889: is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
11890: stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
11891: motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
11892: virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
11893: kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
11897: directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
11899: mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
11900: way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
11901: of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
11902: supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
11907: An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
11909: waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
11910: of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
11913: we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
11915: radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
11916: weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
11919: and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
11920: burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
11921: agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
11922: light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
11923: have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
11925: That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
11930: falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
11931: the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
11933: these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
11934: nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
11935: energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
11936: the Conservation of Energy.
11943: Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
11944: civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
11945: exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
11946: transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
11947: whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
11948: derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
11949: rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
11950: had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
11954: extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
11955: known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
11956: water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
11958: utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
11959: moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
11960: of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
11961: with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
11963: the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
11964: practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
11965: be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
11966: as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
11967: energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
11968: then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
11971: The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
11982: indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
11984: where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
11985: reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
11986: physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
11987: until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
11988: iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
11990: measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
11991: but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
11992: follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
11995: heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
11996: effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
11997: acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
11998: measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
12001: all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
12003: hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
12009: If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
12016: And what does this imply? It implies a great deal: for if all the energy
12017: in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
12018: to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
12019: radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
12021: would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
12035: firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
12043: the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
12044: the liquid air_.]
12046: If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
12047: substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
12050: temperature than this: a lower temperature could not exist. Unless there
12053: absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
12054: in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
12058: But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
12059: If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
12060: _regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
12061: Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
12062: living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
12064: dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
12065: finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
12068: The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
12069: atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
12071: can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
12072: call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
12076:     between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
12077:     natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
12078:     from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
12080:     sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
12081:     which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
12087: and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
12088: receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
12089: really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
12090: energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
12100: The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
12101: nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
12102: electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
12103: disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
12105: some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
12108: the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
12109: vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
12110: possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
12111: difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
12115: be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
12116: the final unification.
12118: We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
12119: is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
12120: part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
12121: imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
12122: and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
12124: the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
12125: 186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
12128: Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
12129: detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
12130: move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
12131: of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
12133: Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
12134: direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
12135: of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
12136: scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
12137: is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
12138: appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
12139: the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
12140: of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
12141: existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
12142: imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
12143: primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
12144: that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
12145: If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
12147: tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
12151: the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
12152: theory more fully in a later section.
12159: Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
12160: modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
12162: mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
12164: some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
12165: man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
12166: somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
12167: What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
12168: the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
12169: ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
12170: himself in the sea.
12173: The Earth Pulled by the Moon
12175: But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
12177: see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
12178: attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
12179: pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
12180: part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
12181: instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
12182: _acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
12183: sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
12184: is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
12185: tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
12186: that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
12187: the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
12188: loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
12189: were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
12190: that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
12191: every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
12192: would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
12193: simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
12197: The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
12198: degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
12199: and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
12200: although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
12201: effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
12202: explained in the text.]
12208: An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
12209: wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
12210: noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
12211: heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
12212: slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
12213: combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
12220: The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
12221: complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
12222: just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
12223: for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
12224: moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
12226: after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
12227: occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
12228: The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
12229: nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
12230: water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
12236: It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
12238: Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
12239: should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
12241: sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
12242: sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
12243: those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
12244: matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
12245: that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
12246: mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
12247: it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
12248: counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
12249: that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
12250: act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
12251: act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
12252: further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
12253: various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
12254: falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
12255: more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
12260: Origin of the Moon
12262: But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
12263: interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
12264: the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
12265: had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
12266: particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
12268: ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
12269: the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
12270: that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
12271: earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
12272: body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
12273: two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
12274: the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
12275: of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
12276: the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
12280: created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
12286: The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
12287: rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
12289: its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
12291: only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
12293: this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
12294: energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
12295: down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
12296: rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
12297: of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
12299: continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
12303: But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
12304: mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
12305: earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
12306: tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
12307: farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
12308: permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
12309: principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
12312: Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
12313: faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
12314: twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
12315: until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
12318: At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
12319: have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
12320: It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
12321: nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
12322: to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
12323: already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
12324: three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
12325: grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
12326: there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
12327: beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
12328: force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
12329: of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
12330: have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
12331: immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
12332: barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
12333: age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
12334: is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
12335: of the earth-moon system.
12340: At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
12341: must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
12342: same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
12343: were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
12344: the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
12345: to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
12346: earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
12347: month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
12348: became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
12349: calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
12350: in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
12352: continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
12353: that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
12354: the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
12355: it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
12356: the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
12357: affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
12358: to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
12359: has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
12360: its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
12361: course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
12362: round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
12363: moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
12366: possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
12367: half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
12368: were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
12370: therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
12371: revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
